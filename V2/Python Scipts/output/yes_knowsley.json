    "text": "Jon's story\nJon Kearney, a Senior Communications Officer, has worked in the Communications team at Knowsley Council since June 2020. Prior to joining Knowsley Council, Jon had previously worked in another local authority. We asked Jon about why he wanted to work for Knowsley Council.\nHere’s what he said . . . .\nWhat does your job involve / what does a typical day look like?\nThere is always a lot of variety and different sets of challenges so no two days are ever really the same. It’s a really diverse role and you engage with people from across the Council, Elected Members, different stakeholders and the media. It means you develop an understanding of what is happening right across the Council and gain an appreciation of how much the Council actually does.\nCommunications ensures timely and accurate information is shared, whether that be internally to staff or externally to businesses and residents.\nWhat is it like working in the Communications team?\nThe best thing about working at Knowsley Council for me is the support I’m given by my team and my managers. In that respect it’s the best place I’ve ever worked. You have a lot more confidence to overcome challenges when you have the backing of the people you work with every day.\nWhy did you want to work for Knowsley Council?\nI has a conversation with my current manager before I applied to get a sense of what it would be like at Knowsley Council, what the job entailed. I immediately had a positive impression about Knowsley Council from this and gained a good understanding of what my role would be and how I would fit into the team.\nWhat do you enjoy most about working for Knowsley Council?\nA really satisfying aspect of the job – and it applies to anyone who works for the Council – is being involved in projects that will potentially benefit thousands of residents.

    "text": "Bethany's story\nBethan Whelan, Website Content Officer, has worked at Knowsley Council since July 2023. We asked Bethany a few questions about her role so far and why she enjoys working at Knowsley Council.\nHere’s what she said . . . .\nWhat does your job involve/what does a typical day look like?\nNo two days are the same! I joined the Council to help to overhaul the existing Council website and make a shiny new one. Initially, I was rewriting content from various services in order to ensure a seamless migration to our new Content Management System (CMS) and ensure we adhered to accessibility guidelines. This was great as it enabled me to meet colleagues from across the Council. Now, with the website live, my focus has shifted towards user feedback from both colleagues and residents. I work with services to address their concerns and implement corrections. Recently, I took part in collaborative feedback on our bins section, resulting in clearer content and therefore improved user satisfaction. It's a constant learning process, but I enjoy the challenge and the opportunity to make the website an even more valuable resource.\nWhat is it like working in your team?\nWhilst small in number, we have the pleasure of sitting alongside the wider Customer Service teams. This creates a vibrant and collaborative atmosphere that I love. My manager is passionate and great at what he does, and we bounce ideas off each other constantly, whether it's crafting website copy or testing out new stand-up material.\nThe open space fosters learning, which is perfect for someone starting their career like me. I feel comfortable asking any question, no matter how basic, and the environment fuels my curiosity.\nWhy did you want to work for Knowsley Council?\nMy dad worked in local government, so honestly, I thought it would be sweet to follow in his footsteps. I also thought building a new website was a super exciting project to get my teeth stuck into, put some skills to good use and produce work that I (and my dad) would be proud of.\nWhat do you enjoy most about working for Knowsley Council?\nWorking for Knowsley Council keeps on surprising me. Coming from a background in various start-ups, I was worried that I would find working in a Local Authority a bit drab, but I can honestly say it’s the most vibrant environment I’ve ever worked in! The people I work alongside in Customer Services make me feel comfortable and they’re happy to answer any question I have. I love the opportunity to work from home as it adds a bit of variety to my routine. The location has great central transport routes too meaning that I can get to work stress free from Liverpool. Also, the charity shops are great in Huyton Village so that is an extra perk when working from the office.\nWhy would you recommend working for Knowsley Council?\nThere are so many teams and projects on the go in Knowsley. The council employs a wide range of roles, which means you’ll be able to find a role that matches your interests and skills. There are opportunities for growth and development throughout the Council and it’s a great place to get stuck in and feel part of a team.",
