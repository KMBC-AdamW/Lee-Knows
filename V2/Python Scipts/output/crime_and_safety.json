    "text": "About domestic abuse\nMany people think that domestic abuse is only about intimate partners, but it is important to remember that other family members can also be victims, and that much safeguarding work that occurs at home with both children and adults is concerned with domestic abuse.\nOn 29 April 2021, the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 became law. This has provided us with a statutory definition of domestic abuse, emphasising that it is not just physical violence, but can also be emotional, controlling or coercive, and economic abuse.\nIn addition, the Act:\nExtends the controlling or coercive behaviour offence to cover post-separation abuse.\nA child who sees, hears, or experiences the effects of domestic abuse and is related to the person being abused or the abuser, will also to be regarded as a victim of domestic abuse in their own right.\nExtends the offence of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress (known as the “revenge porn” offence) to cover threats to disclose such material.\nCreates a new offence of non-fatal strangulation or suffocation of another person.\nEnables domestic abuse offenders to be subject to polygraph testing as a condition of their licence following their release from custody.\nPlaces the guidance supporting the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (“Clare’s law”) on a statutory footing.\nProvides that all eligible homeless victims of domestic abuse automatically have ‘priority need’ for homelessness assistance.\nExtends the controlling or coercive behaviour offence to cover post-separation abuse.\nA child who sees, hears, or experiences the effects of domestic abuse and is related to the person being abused or the abuser, will also to be regarded as a victim of domestic abuse in their own right.\nExtends the offence of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress (known as the “revenge porn” offence) to cover threats to disclose such material.\nCreates a new offence of non-fatal strangulation or suffocation of another person.\nEnables domestic abuse offenders to be subject to polygraph testing as a condition of their licence following their release from custody.\nPlaces the guidance supporting the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (“Clare’s law”) on a statutory footing.\nProvides that all eligible homeless victims of domestic abuse automatically have ‘priority need’ for homelessness assistance.\nRead more on the Domestic Abuse Act, 2021 and its full reach",

This gives the victim time to consider their options and get the support they need.\nDVPOs are often used when there is not enough evidence to charge the perpetrator with a criminal offence, or when the victim does not want to press charges. They can also be used in addition to criminal charges.\nHow to apply for a DVPO\nIf you are a victim of domestic violence, you can apply for a DVPO by contacting the police. They will assess your situation and decide whether a DVPO is necessary. If it is, they will help you to apply for one.\nWhat happens if a DVPO is granted?\nIf a DVPO is granted, the perpetrator will be served with a notice. This notice will tell them what they are not allowed to do, such as returning to the specific residence or having contact with the victim.

The support is tailored to each case and can include help with family problems, mental health, mentoring, religious support, and more.\nPeople who are referred to Channel are not criminals, but they may be at risk of committing an offence if not supported.\nThe programme can provide training for staff in partner agencies (such as Education, Health, Prison, Probation, Youth Offending, Fire Service, Police etc) and key organisations within the private sector. The training facilitates organisations to identify individuals who may be at risk of supporting violent extremism and how to refer them for support.\nAn escalation process to strategic governance is in place for the Channel Panel.

    "text": "Illicit alcohol is alcohol that is produced or sold illegally.\nTypes of illicit alcohol\nCounterfeit alcohol\nThis is alcohol that is made to look like a genuine brand, but it is actually not. Counterfeit alcohol may contain hazardous substances, such as methanol.\nMethanol is a non-drinking alcohol substance that is used for industrial purposes only. It can be found in products like anti-freeze and paint remover.\nIf methanol is consumed it can lead to breathing difficulties, liver damage or even death.\nNon-duty paid alcohol\nThis is alcohol that has been smuggled into the country without paying the proper taxes. Non-duty paid alcohol although not counterfeit it is still illegal to buy or sell.\nHow to identify illicit alcohol\nUnfamiliar brand name\nIf you don't recognise the brand name, it's a good chance that the alcohol is illicit.\nLow price\nIllicit alcohol is often sold at a much lower price than genuine alcohol. This is because it doesn't have to pay the same taxes and doesn't have the same production costs.\nUnusual taste or smell\nIllicit alcohol may taste or smell different from genuine alcohol.\nLow quality labelling and packaging\nIllicit alcohol often has low quality labelling and packaging. This may include misspelled words, grammatical errors, or poor printing quality.\nNo 'UK Duty Paid' stamp\nGenuine alcohol in the UK will have a 'UK Duty Paid' stamp. If the alcohol you're buying doesn't have this stamp, it's likely to be illicit.\nForeign brand names\nIf the alcohol has a foreign brand name, it's important to check that it is being sold legally in the UK.\nNo manufacturer details\nGenuine alcohol will have the manufacturer's details on the label. If the alcohol you're buying doesn't have this information, it's likely to be illicit.\nWhere to buy alcohol safely\nOnly buy alcohol from reputable traders, such as licensed supermarkets and off-licenses.\nAvoid buying alcohol from residential properties, vehicles, or markets. This alcohol is more likely to be illicit.\nSelling illicit alcohol\nThe maximum sentence for selling illicit alcohol is ten years in prison. If you are convicted, the courts have the power to seize your assets, including jewellery and the family home.\nReport illicit alcohol\nAny information received about manufacturers, importers, distributors, businesses or individuals dealing in illegal alcohol products will be investigated by Trading Standards. Action will be taken against those found to be breaking the law and this can include prosecutions.\nWho to Contact\nKnowsley Council\nEmail us (\nTradingstandardsteam@knowsley.gov.uk\n)\nTelephone\n0151 443 4712\nCitizens Advice consumer helpline\n0808 223 1133\n.

This includes cigarettes, hand-rolling tobacco, and niche products (such as blunts and Shisha).\nWhere does illicit tobacco come from\nSmuggled\nThese are generally legitimately-manufactured tobacco products which have evaded payment of tax by being illegally transported, distributed and sold.\nBootlegged, also known as ‘illicit whites’\nTobacco products which are purchased in a country with a low level of taxation and illegally brought into the UK, evading payment of tax.\nCounterfeit\nThese are illegally-manufactured tobacco products which are often made abroad, but sometimes in the UK. They are sold cheaply and tax free and vast profits are made throughout the supply chain.\nThe effects of illicit tobacco\nIllicit tobacco harms our local communities in many different ways\nIt damages local businesses by undercutting them with cheap prices.\nIt is often sold alongside drugs and other counterfeit goods, bringing criminal activity to the area.\nIt helps young people start smoking at an early age and discourages people from quitting.\nIt increases the risk of house fires, as illegal cigarettes do not meet the same safety standards as legitimate products.\nIt costs the NHS billions of pounds every year in treating smoking-related health conditions.\nIt brings criminal activity to the area, helping to fund crime and organised gangs.\nHow to identify illicit tobacco\nNo \"UK Duty Paid\" fiscal mark\nSpelling mistakes and/or altered logos\nUnfamiliar brands, labelling, or text\nPrice, if 20 cigarettes cost less than £3.50\nForeign or no health warnings/pictures\nWhere illicit tobacco is commonly sold\nIllicit tobacco is normally sold cheaply from places such as\nPubs\nSunbeds\nCar boot sales\nIce cream vans\nResidential homes\nWhere to buy legitimate tobacco products\nTo ensure you are purchasing legitimate tobacco products, always buy from a reputable retailer who is less likely to sell illicit tobacco.\nOur aim\nKnowsley Council is working with partners to\nDisrupt and eliminate criminal organisations which deal in illegal and non-duty paid tobacco products.\nAssist local agencies and other key partners to thoroughly investigate the importation and distribution of illegal and non-duty paid tobacco products.\nRaise awareness of the harmful effects of tobacco products on young people, peers, and the Knowsley community.\nInvestigate and prosecute any person concerned in the sale or supply of tobacco products to any child.\nSelling illicit tobacco\nDid you know that if your employees are involved with illegal tobacco sales at work, it is you who could face prosecution? Turning a blind eye is not an option. It is your responsibility to ensure that illegal tobacco sales are not taking place on your premises.\nThe sale of illegal tobacco products is a serious crime, and it can have a number of negative consequences for your business, including fines up to £5,000.\nReport illicit tobacco\nAny information received about manufacturers, importers, distributors, businesses or individuals dealing in illegal alcohol products will be investigated by Trading Standards. Action will be taken against those found to be breaking the law and this can include prosecutions.\nYou can report it anonymously to the Illegal Tobacco Helpline on\n0300 999 0000\nor online via the\nIllegal Tobacco: Keep it out website\n.\nWho to Contact\nKnowsley Council\nEmail us (\nTradingstandardsteam@knowsley.gov.uk\n)\nTelephone\n0151 443 4712\nCitizens Advice consumer helpline\n0808 223 1133\n.

    "text": "Domestic abuse is a significant national and local issue, having a major impact on those directly affected and their families. Domestic abuse has significant short and long-term effects on victims and their families; this includes physical injuries, mental health issues, and behavioural issues that can lead to substance misuse, self-harm, and suicide. There are, sadly, occasions when domestic abuse can result in the death of a person, which is known as a domestic homicide.\nA “domestic homicide” is defined as the death of a person aged 16 or over which has, or appears to have, resulted from violence, abuse or neglect either by a person to whom the deceased was related or with whom the deceased was in an intimate relationship with, or was a member of the same household as the victim.  Under these circumstances, Section 9 of the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act 2004 places a legal duty on the Knowsley Community Safety Partnership (the Partnership) to conduct a Review into a death. In Knowsley, the Community Safety Service coordinates the review process following the completion/conclusion of any criminal justice process.\nThe Knowsley Community Safety Partnership must appoint an Independent Author and an Independent Chairperson to undertake the domestic homicide review. The purpose of a domestic homicide review is to:\nEstablish lessons which could be learned regarding the way in which local professionals and organisations work individually and together to safeguard victims.\nIdentify clearly what those lessons are within and between agencies, how and within what timescales they will be acted on, and what is expected to change.\nApply these lessons to service responses, including changes to inform national and local policies and procedures as appropriate.\nPrevent domestic violence and homicide and improve service responses for all domestic violence and abuse victims.\nContribute to a better understanding on the nature of domestic violence and abuse; and,\nHighlight good practice.\nFor information in relation to Knowsley domestic homicide reviews/domestic abuse-related deaths, please email\nDHR@knowsley.gov.uk.\nRecent Knowsley domestic homicide reviews (DHR KMBC)\nDHR KMBC01\nOverview report KMBC01 (2013)\nAction Plan KMBC01 (2013)\nDHR KMBC 02/ Safeguarding Adults Review (SAR)\nSAR/DHR Overview report into the death of Margaret (2016)-not published.\nSummary report into the death of Margaret -not published.\nHome Office Feedback Letter - not published.\nAction Plan Margaret -not published.\nFor information in relation to DHR KMBC 02/ Safeguarding Adults Review (SAR), email\nDHR@knowsley.gov.uk\nDHR KMBC03\nOverview report into the death of Victoria (2017) – not published.\nAction Plan Victoria (2017) – not published.\nHome Office Feedback Letter Victoria (2021) – not published\nFor information in relation to DHR KMBC 03:  email\nDHR@knowsley.gov.uk\nDHR KMBC04\nOverview report into the death of Alison (2020) - not published.\nAction Plan - Alison (2020) – not published.\nHome Office Feedback Letter – 2023 - not published.\nFor information in relation to DHR KMBC 04: email\nDHR@knowsley.gov.uk\nDHR KMBC05\nOverview report into the death of Diana (2020)\nAction Plan - Diana\nHome Office Feedback Letter – Diana 2024 - not published.\nFor information in relation to DHR KMBC 05: email\nDHR@knowsley.gov.uk\nFurther information\nHome Office multi-agency statutory guidance for the conduct of domestic homicide reviews\nLeaflets from the Home Office website\nAAFDA - Advocacy After Fatal Domestic Abuse\n- offers support to those affected by a domestic homicide, regardless of whether they are involved in a homicide review",
