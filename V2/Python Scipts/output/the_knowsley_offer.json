You can find a list of all Knowsley practices and contact information\nhere\n.\nGPs offer face to face appointments, telephone and video consultations alongside other options including home visits where appropriate.\nAll practices also offer an online consultation tool available during core hours to access advice, support or treatment. Patients are also able to access their GP medical record online. Please check with your practice how to do this.\nCurrent picture\nAround 70,000 GP appointments take place each week in Knowsley (as of November 2022) – this is actually more than took place before the pandemic.\nDemand is incredibly high currently and GPs are increasingly seeing patients with complex needs and health conditions. At the same time, the numbers of GPs across the country – and in Knowsley – has declined over the last ten years which means, at times, residents may experience issues getting an appointment.\nSpecifically, we know from speaking to our residents and from data from GP Patient surveys that people are experiencing problems getting through to their GP practice. This can be frustrating and also distressing for people needing support.\nWhat we are doing to help\nHere in Knowsley work is taking place with GPs and other health professionals to address the issues being experienced.\nWhilst there are no ‘quick fix’ solutions to some of the problems, partners in Knowsley are working together to improve experiences and outcomes.\nAll GP practices offer and promote to patients the following additional means of accessing advice, support or treatment:\nAn online consultation tool available during core hours\nOnline access for patients to their GP medical record\nA video consultation tool\nA secure electronic communication method\nAn online facility to provide and update personal or contact information.\nThe NHS App to access advice and support and to order repeat prescriptions\nAll Knowsley GP practices now operate a triage system to direct people to the right support quickly. More work is ongoing with GPs to offer a consistent standard across practices and to improve communication with patients\nFrom October 2022, groups of GPs (Primary Care Networks of which there are three in Knowsley) are offering more appointments for residents who may struggle to attend appointments during working hours. Please check your local practice for information\nGPs are working together to recruit to additional roles such as social prescribers, pharmacists, physiotherapists and mental health workers to create more capacity and ease the pressure on GPs\nImprovements are being made to some practice websites and outbound communications to ensure clear and consistent messages are shared with patients\nMore work is being done to measure the demand for telephone access at GPs during working hours to identify and address issues at peak times\nImprovements are being made to digital access for patients wishing to use these services\nEnhanced customer care training is being rolled out for some practice teams to improve patient experience",

    "text": "Public health\nPublic Health services are different to the health services provided by the NHS and GPs in that they are primarily concerned with supporting people to maintain good health throughout their lives. Public Health services are delivered by the Council and aim to improve the health and wellbeing of Knowsley residents by preventing health issues from arising in the first place.\nKnowsley’s Public Health team does this by making sure that health and wellbeing are at the heart of everything the Council does. It also works closely with partners across the borough to influence them to do the same. This includes working in partnership with local organisations, the community and voluntary sector and businesses too.\nThe team also works with local GPs, dentists and hospitals to help them identify, prioritise, and address health needs. This includes promoting self care the uptake of vital preventative services, positive lifestyles and early intervention and prevention.\nThis service recognises that maintaining good health can make considerable positive differences to people throughout the course of their life.\nStart Well\nFamilies are encouraged to make healthy choices for themselves and their baby before conception, and through pregnancy and birth.\nGrow well\nChildren and young people are encouraged to achieve well in school, build resilience to help them cope with life’s challenges and make a positive healthy journey into adulthood.\nLive well\nA good work-life balance is key to our personal health and wellbeing. Local people are supported into good quality jobs and encouraged to make positive lifestyle choices that reduce the risks to their health such as alcohol and drugs use, smoking, obesity, and sexual health issues.\nAge well\nWith the right choices and support, more people will live healthier lives and stay independent for longer. People with long term illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease have the best possible quality of life and are able to make choices about their care. Plans to reduce the effects of infectious diseases, such as flu, are also in place.\nHealth Protection\nThe council’s Public Health team works with a wide range of partners including GP practices, pharmacies, NHS England, social care and community groups to help ensure residents are protected from infectious diseases, incidents and outbreaks.\nThis can include providing training and support to vulnerable settings and groups as well as outbreak management to stop the spread of disease.  A good example of this would be the response and leadership given to the COVID-19 pandemic but also includes response to flu, norovirus and other infections.\nVaccinations\nThe Council supports the NHS to promote the uptake of vaccines, which are the most effective way to prevent infectious diseases.\nGetting vaccinated is the single most important thing you can do to protect yourself and your children against ill health.\nGet your annual winter flu jab, your GP practice will invite you if you are eligible\nKeep up to date with childhood immunisations, speak to your GP practice if you think your child may have missed one\nCheck eligibility and book a COVID-19 vaccine or booster at\nnhs.uk/covidvaccine\nor by calling 119\nOther support and initiatives\nKnowsley’s Public Health team work on a wide range of projects to improve the health and wellbeing of residents.

    "text": "Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service\nAdvice from Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service\nHome fire safety checks\nEach year Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) carry out approximately 50,000 of these checks in person. They identify, target and visit the most at risk community members through information sharing agreements, partner agency referrals and deprivation data. MFRS works with partners to identify and target the most vulnerable people living in Merseyside and deliver interventions to raise awareness and promote safety in the home.\nSafe and Well checks\nMFRS provide around 10,000 Safe and Well visits which are carried out by Prevention Advocates across Merseyside. The Safe and Well visit focuses on key aspects of health and in most cases connects people with partner agencies for further assessment as well as addressing fire safety concerns in the home. This intervention includes falls risk assessment, fuel poverty, alcohol reduction and smoking cessation.\nTarget hardening\nMFRS responds to incidents where fire has been used or threatened against a person or a property. The aim is to offer advice to make the person safer and the property more resistant to the potential of fire. This process is known as ‘target hardening’.\nEach property is target hardened based upon a number of factors which form the basis of a risk assessment. Residents are offered specific advice and guidance based upon the potential risks encountered. This is specific to each location, internal layout, external surroundings and lifestyles of the occupant/s.\nYouth Engagement Activities\nMFRS offers several different Youth Education programmes, including Prince’s Trust, Beacon program and Fire Cadets. These programmes are delivered across Merseyside and engage with children as young as nine through to adults.\nThe Prince’s Trust Team Programme is a 12-week course run at fire stations across Merseyside for young people aged 16 to 25 who are not in employment or education.\nIt aims to develop young people’s skills to strengthen their job prospects. During the course they complete a week-long residential stay, a four-week community project and two weeks’ work experience.\nTeams of young people on the course also raise money for community projects.\nTeams currently operate from Bootle and Netherton Community Fire Station, Prescot Community Fire Station and Wallasey Community Fire Station.\nMFRS currently run the National Fire Cadets Programme in a number of fire stations across Merseyside for 13-17 year olds.\nThe aim of the Fire Cadets is to enable young people to gain skills and knowledge and have positive experiences in a fun, safe and secure environment, while developing life skills and inspiring positive life choices about their futures.\nThe Beacon Project, supported by Merseyside Violence Reduction Partnership, is a six week or 12 week (one day a week) programme designed to engage with young people aged 8-18 who meet any of the following criteria:\nThey are in their transition to secondary school\nThey have experienced ACEs (Adverse Childhood Experience)\nThey have poor attendance\nThey are displaying symptoms of someone exposed to trauma\nThey are involved in risk-taking behaviour, fire setting or becoming involved in ASB (anti-social behaviour)\nYoung people socially excluded in less obvious ways are also eligible – young carers, young people with disabilities, looked after children, young people from Global Ethnic Majority backgrounds.\nBusiness safety advice\nMFRS has a legal duty to enforce the Fire Safety Order and promote fire safety in places such as offices, factories, shops, public buildings and high rise buildings. This helps to reduce the impact of fire in communities, keep firefighters safe and protect the area’s heritage and the environment. This helps reduce the number of fire related injuries, loss of life and cost to businesses and the community. MFRS support business and communities to meet their legal fire safety duties. Over 65,000 places in Merseyside have been identified that need to comply with the Fire Safety Order. Fire Safety Inspectors visit 7,500 very high and risk premises, including all of the High-Rise-Residential Buildings in Merseyside, and firefighters will visit a further 6,336 low to medium risk premises, between 2021-2024.",

These are monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and operators can link in directly to Merseyside Police’s Control Room to report incidents live as they happen.\n“Our direct link with Knowsley Council’s Control Room has been a valuable resource in our continued and proactive work to address crime and anti-social behaviour in Knowsley. The continued investment from Knowsley Council demonstrates its commitment to building safer communities and gives us even further opportunity to build an intelligence picture of what is happening in our communities so we can respond accordingly.”\nSuperintendent Karl Baldwin, Knowsley’s Local Policing Team",

Sadly, we know this is not always the case and as a result Knowsley Council and its partners are heavily involved in work to reduce incidents of violence against women and girls. This can include domestic abuse but also coercive controlling behaviour, honour-based abuse, revenge porn, sexual violence, stalking and modern slavery.\nAs part of its commitment the Council has commissioned specialist training to educate young people on the importance of preventing violence against women and girls.\nDelivered by local charity, CELLS (Choices Education Lifelong Learning Skills), secondary schools across the borough have received the training. The sessions form part of a wider programme of activity in Knowsley that addresses the safety of women and girls at night. This extensive programme of activity is funded by almost £190,000 from the Home Office.\nA number of other initiatives are also being delivered in the Borough to raise awareness of this important issue including:\nAsk for Angela\nThe Ask for Angela scheme invites women to ask for ‘Angela’ if they feel unsafe when on a night out –  bar, restaurant, taxi companies and security staff in Huyton Village Centre and Prescot and Kirkby Town Centres will then be able to help. Read more about the scheme\nhere.\nLocal policing\nSignificantly the funding is being used to increase policing resources, specifically during the evening in Huyton, Prescot and Kirkby where there is a growing night-time economy.\nHow to report\nIf you have any information or concerns regarding violence against woman and girls, call 999 in an emergency or alternatively ring the police on 101.\nYou can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or the Crime and Communities Team on\nsafer.knowsley@knowsley.gov.uk\n.",

In the last year, the Crime and Communities team has:-\nWalked more than 520 miles of the borough’s streets to engage with residents, providing a visible deterrent and reassuring presence.\nVisited more than 5,000 households to engage with residents about issues impacting on them.\nCompleted 250 “Walkabout Wednesdays” across the borough, targeting specific areas and issues identified by communities, providing a reassuring presence, visible deterrent and gathering community intelligence.\nArranged regular “Talkabout Tuesday” events in prominent locations such as supermarkets and shopping areas to discuss issues that matter to local residents.\nGathered community intelligence and improved confidence within the community that they are being listened to and their issues are being addressed.\nThe investment into this team has also funded a quad bike, enabling Merseyside Police to directly respond to incidents of anti-social behaviour, particularly in parks and green spaces\nTo find out more about the Crime and Communities Team, or to share information about crime in your area, email\nSafer.knowsley@knowsley.gov.uk\n.",

This could include emotional and mental health needs, learning and behavioural difficulties, suffering trauma, substance misuse and educational disadvantage.\nThe Knowsley Youth Justice Service aims to address the causes swiftly to help children move away from offending and contribute positively to their communities.\nThe service works together with the Police, the Probation Service, Education, and Health services to reduce the number of children committing crimes, entering custody and/or re-offending.\nTo support this work, the Council has allocated £650,000 for targeted and specialist work that is attached to the Knowsley Youth Justice Service. This has created a Prevention team named STEP (Support, Together, Empower, Prevent) who work with children to prevent them from committing crimes and to improve their life chances.\nWe do this by:\nPreventing children from committing crimes and getting into trouble\nHelp stop children from getting into trouble again\nWorking with Courts to show them that working with us is better than custody\nHelping children and families early, to help them achieve their potential\nViewing all children as children first, not based on what they have done\nListening to children and ask for their views on how we can do things better\nUnderstanding children’s individual experiences and how they have shaped them\nSupporting children through important changes in their lives Help children who are affected by gangs\nHelping children to do well in education, training or employment\nCreating communities where people feel safe, and violence by children and to children is not acceptable\nKeeping children safe and help to protect them from harm\nSupporting people who are harmed by crime\nSupporting children to help them manage their problems\nSupporting children to achieve goals and plan for their future\nMaking sure Youth Justice staff are good at their job\nSupporting children to use their strengths and to be positive members of their community\nSupporting children to live happy and healthy lives\nDownloads\nKnowsley Youth Justice Service leaflet",

In return you help to contribute to local democracy.\nRoles include assisting with the annual canvass to ensure everyone entitled to vote is able to do so, and subsequently distributing polling cards, as well as staffing the polling stations on election day with roles as a Poll Clerk or (if you have previous experience in this respect) as a Presiding Officer.\nTo find out more about any election opportunities, contact Tom Baker, Elections, Members and Civic Services Manager, on 0151 443 2222  or by email on\nelections@knowsley.gov.uk\n.",

    "text": "Town centres\nEach of Knowsley’s town centres offer residents a unique range of local amenities, shops and leisure attractions to enjoy. Creating an environment where vibrant local centres can thrive is a key priority for the council. The council has invested over £120 million over the last five years to bring improvements to our town centres, successfully attracting new businesses and an improved and enhanced retail and hospitality offer creating a night time economy. This investment continues with further developments in the pipeline.\nOur consultation findings, carried out over the summer of 2022, asked a number of questions relating to our town centres. The findings highlighted that 91% of people could access shops in their town centre, 81% agreed there were restaurants and pubs in their local area and 86% agreed they could access a local library or leisure centre.\nThe council is currently providing free car parking in all council-owned car parks across all town centres. There is a range of short-stay (up to 3 hours) and long-stay parking bays. Short-stay restrictions are still being enforced.\nHalewood\nThe council has ambitious plans to invest in the extension of the local district centre in Halewood – a development initially delivered by the Council in 2012. The current centre includes an Aldi supermarket, Iceland, Home Bargains, Subway and other retail units, along with parking for 300 cars, a library, an NHS Walk-In centre and GP surgeries.\nThe council is keen to develop the local offer and invest further in the area for the benefit of local residents. With new housing developments underway the population is set to grow even more. In response, the council is making £4.4m of major road improvements and using £9m of private sector contributions to increase school places and enhance early years services. Finch Woods is being improved and maintained, and public transport for residents improved.\nThe proposed extension and development of the district centre will see this area expand, as well as improvements and enhancements made to the green space. This will include better links, and a new facility for the Junior Football club.\nKnowsley Council has secured (in January 2023) £15.3m of funding from the Government’s Levelling Up Fund to support its development plans for Halewood. They include an expansion of the local district centre, improvements to greenspace and leisure facilities, as well as funding improvements to walking and cycling connectivity throughout the town and to employment areas.\nHuyton\nHuyton Village Centre is a well-established shopping destination for the local community. Home to the main civic campus of the Borough, the Village Centre is well served by public transport and offers a range of independent and national retailers alongside a growing night-time economy and an events programme (subject to the availability of funding).\nThe council has a 10-year development plan to further improve Huyton Village Centre with work already well underway to enhance the local area creating new opportunities for retail, leisure, commercial and residential development.\nIn the last three years in particular, the Village Centre has established its own blossoming night-time economy. This has been supported by an extensive programme of improvements to shop fronts, which have seen the installation of new windows, doors, signage and lighting across the village centre. These key improvements have allowed for more food and beverage operators to consider Huyton, with a range of establishments opening up. This includes a Steak House alongside Mediterranean, Italian, Greek and Turkish eateries.\nPlans are currently progressing to bring a “maker-space” into the Village Centre (in the former Boots building). Maker spaces provide a location for people to gather to co-create, share ideas, resources and knowledge, work on projects, network, and build. Many use the maker-space building as an opportunity to develop their skills, develop networks and use it as a first step to venture out into the business world.\nKey sites are primed and ready for development which has included the demolition of outdated buildings and site works so that they are ready for future development.\nThe train station has also benefitted from investment alongside improvements to CCTV and the illumination of key gateway landmarks – Archway Road railway bridge and St Michael’s Church.\nFuture plans include the creation of a commercial district (which will include the council’s HQ, a hotel, commercial and residential accommodation), a village green and significant improvements to the high street and station gateway area. This provides the potential for approximately 1,700 jobs and a £50.8m boost to the local economy.\nKirkby\nKirkby has undergone a major transformation over the last few years thanks to the council’s multi-million investment to buy and expand the town centre offer.\nSince that purchase, the Council has worked to deliver a 94,000 sq ft retail development – constructed in just under two years. Kirkby is now home to a Morrisons superstore, petrol filling station, large Home Bargains, drive-thru KFC and Taco Bell restaurants as well as PureGym. It also provides over 450 free parking spaces for visitors and has created jobs locally for 500 people.\nAlongside the new additions, Kirkby Town Centre is also home to an array of established high-street shops and the undercover Kirkby Market with around 80 stalls (which has recently benefitted from a £50,000 makeover).\nPrescot\nPrescot’s transformation in recent years has been nothing short of spectacular, with the Council and partners investing millions of pounds in the town centre. Central to Prescot’s rejuvenation is the\nShakespeare North Playhouse\nwhich opened its doors in July 2022.\nCelebrating Prescot’s links to Elizabethan theatre – and to Shakespeare himself – the Playhouse is a world-class arts venue that will attract thousands of visitors to the town each year. Much more than providing a new theatre, studio space, outdoor performance garden, café bar and shop, the Playhouse also offers an education programme and lots of community events and access.\nIn recognition of the increasing visitor numbers expected in the town, the town centre has also changed significantly in recent years, with new businesses opening-up, independent retailers moving to the town and Prescot now has a well-established night-time economy.\nAlongside the new mix of retailers, the town’s historic buildings are being restored and major investments made to improve the Prescot railway station and bus station. Funding has also improved the general appearance and connectivity in the town centre, with new signage, paving and striking public art.\nIn December 2022, the Council purchased Prescot Shopping Centre in order to further develop the town centre. The purchase also includes the former Stephenson’s Printworks building, additional retail units on Eccleston Street, Market Place and all car parking at the shopping centre. With the site now in their ownership, the Council reopened the full car park on site, ensuring all car parking spaces are available. The Council also plans to make improvements to the shopping centre to attract new occupiers and will begin work on additional shop front improvements on Eccleston Street. The Council is also planning to consult with the community and local businesses for their views on the future of the centre.\nBy buying the site, the Council is also able to secure future car parking provision in the town centre, providing spaces for the many visitors to the town and to support the new Shakespeare North Playhouse.",

The Council, Police, housing partners, health services and more are all working collaboratively in the Borough to improve outcomes and experiences.  And – in the spirit of Knowsley Better Together – there are opportunities for residents to play their part too. From small changes in your daily life to dedicating your time or expertise to help out a good cause – the options are endless.\nThere are so many examples of people, families and groups making a difference in their local area. From checking in on your elderly neighbour to organising a litter pick, donating unwanted items to a local charity to offering your time to support your local Foodbank.\nYou are already probably doing more than you think to support your local community but there are always opportunities to get more involved.\nAnd remember – by working together, we can achieve more for Knowsley.\nLook after yourself\nLook after your neighbours\nLook after your neighbourhood\nLook after our planet",

We all know that life can be challenging so making time to take care of for yourself – even if it's just to take a walk or talk to a friend – is something we should all try to do.\nContact with other people and building connections in your local community can also be beneficial to your mental health – especially if you live alone.\nThere’s lot of useful information about community groups and activities on\nthe Live Well Directory\n.\nFor older people who live alone and might be missing the joy of regular conversation, Age UK and their partner charity\nThe Silver Line\ncan help. They offer free telephone friendship services so that people can enjoy chatting with someone over the phone, all from the comfort of your own home. Call 0800 470 80 90.\nAdvice from Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service\nHome fire safety checks\nEach year Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) carry out approximately 50,000 of these checks in person. They identify, target and visit the most at risk community members through information sharing agreements, partner agency referrals and deprivation data. MFRS works with partners to identify and target the most vulnerable people living in Merseyside and deliver interventions to raise awareness and promote safety in the home.\nSafe and Well Checks\nMFRS provide around 10,000 Safe and Well visits which are carried out by Prevention Advocates across Merseyside. The Safe and Well visit focuses on key aspects of health and in most cases connects people with partner agencies for further assessment as well as addressing fire safety concerns in the home. This intervention includes falls risk assessment, fuel poverty, alcohol reduction and smoking cessation.\nTarget hardening\nMFRS responds to incidents where fire has been used or threatened against a person or a property. The aim is to offer advice in order to make the person safer and the property more resistant to the potential of fire. This process is known as ‘target hardening’.\nEach property is target hardened based upon a number of factors which form the basis of a risk assessment. Residents are offered specific advice and guidance based upon the potential risks encountered. This is specific to each location, internal layout, external surroundings and lifestyles of the occupant/s.\nYouth engagement activities\nMFRS offers several different Youth Education programmes, including Prince’s Trust, Beacon program and Fire Cadets. These programmes are delivered across Merseyside and engage with children as young as 9 through to adults.\nThe Prince’s Trust Team Programme is a 12-week course run at fire stations across Merseyside for young people aged 16 to 25 who are not in employment or education.\nIt aims to develop young people’s skills to strengthen their job prospects. During the course they complete a week-long residential stay, a four-week community project and two weeks’ work experience.\nTeams of young people on the course also raise money for community projects.\nTeams currently operate from Bootle and Netherton Community Fire Station, Prescot Community Fire Station and Wallasey Community Fire Station.\nMFRS currently run the National Fire Cadets Programme in a number of fire stations across Merseyside for 13-17 year olds.\nThe aim of the Fire Cadets is to enable young people to gain skills and knowledge and have positive experiences in a fun, safe and secure environment, while developing life skills and inspiring positive life choices about their futures.\nThe Beacon Project, supported by Merseyside Violence Reduction Partnership, is a six week or 12 week (one day a week) programme designed to engage with primary and secondary young people aged 8-18 who meet any of the following criteria:\nThey are in their transition to secondary school\nThey have experienced ACEs (Adverse Childhood Experience)\nThey have poor attendance\nThey are displaying symptoms of someone exposed to trauma\nThey are involved in risk-taking behaviour, fire setting or becoming involved in ASB (anti-social behaviour)\nYoung people socially excluded in less obvious ways are also eligible – young carers, young people with disabilities, looked after children, young people from minority ethnic backgrounds\nBusiness safety advice\nMFRS has a legal duty to enforce the Fire Safety Order and promote fire safety in places such as offices, factories, shops, public buildings and high rise buildings. This helps to reduce the impact of fire in communities, keep firefighters safe and protect the area’s heritage and the environment. This helps reduce the number of fire related injuries, loss of life and cost to businesses and the community. MFRS support business and communities to meet their legal fire safety duties. Over 65,000 places in Merseyside have been identified that need to comply with the Fire Safety Order. Fire Safety Inspectors visit 7,500 very high and risk premises, including all of the High-Rise-Residential Buildings in Merseyside, and firefighters will visit a further 6,336 low to medium risk premises, between 2021-2024.",

You may have a neighbour who lives alone, someone on your street with mobility issues or a family who are new to the area. Just being aware of your neighbours, saying hello and sharing a brief conversation can make a big difference.\nKnowsley is well-known for its strong community spirit. This was particularly evident throughout the pandemic with lots of people volunteering to help others, delivering food parcels, picking up prescriptions, walking dogs for people who had to self-isolate or just popping in for a cuppa to check that their vulnerable relative or neighbour was okay. All these things meant a lot and made a difference to the community as a whole.\nJust taking the time to check-in on others is appreciated so much – for many, it can be their only contact and so to know someone cares can be invaluable.\nIdeas to consider\nPutting your neighbour’s bin out / putting it back\nDo they need help with their recycling?\nCheck on vulnerable neighbours or relatives to see if they need any shopping picking up\nDo they like to read a paper? Could you pick one up when you’re out and about?\nDo they need a lift to a doctor’s or hospital appointment?\nDo they have pets they may need a hand with? Dog walking or feeding them if their owner feels unwell\nCall or pop in to see them on a regular basis to check that they are okay or just make them a cuppa\nHave you cooked too much?

    "text": "Buses\nEvery community in Knowsley is within 400m of a bus route.\nThere are four main bus interchanges in the borough – Huyton, Kirkby, Prescot, Halewood linking the Borough with Liverpool city centre, St Helens, Widnes, and Warrington.  Prescot bus station has recently benefitted from investment which includes new bus shelters and street lighting. Improvements have been made to dropped crossings and signalised crossing facilities and all the footways and carriageway within the bus station have been resurfaced.\nBus services are delivered by private bus operators, with some oversight by Merseytravel.  All bus journeys in Knowsley benefit from a new £2 single flat fare. Where private bus operators choose not to run a service, the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority review whether a service is required and contract bus operators to deliver these services (supported bus services).  These services are reviewed on a periodic basis, and the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority guarantee that Knowsley residents will have the opportunity to comment on any changes before they are made.\nThe Liverpool City Region Combined Authority has set out plans to improve bus services in a Bus Service Improvement Plan.  Some of the improvements in the plan are already underway, such as the new £2 single bus fare, new hydrogen buses for the 10A route and improving bus journey speeds and reliability, also on the 10A route.  However, these plans rely on funding from the Government and additional funding is required to make further improvements to the network such as additional bus services in Halewood and to Whiston Hospital which residents would like to see.\nYou can read the\nLiverpool City Region Bus Improvement Plan here\n.\nNew zero emission hydrogen-powered buses will be operating in Knowsley in 2023.\nMulti-mode and multi-operator transport tickets are available, enabling people to use more than one operator for journeys.\nEnhanced concessionary free travel for residents (over-60 and including rail) is available.\nView the Liverpool bus network map\nFind bus timetables, travel information, and plan your journey",
