Sponsors/hosts of those previously on Homes for Ukraine visas will be eligible for thank-you payments of £350 a month for the 18 months that guests are covered by the UPE visa.\nThank you payments will not be payable if there is a close family relationship between sponsor/host and guest. Sponsors/hosts who are related to their guests who are currently in receipt of thank you payments, and whose guest transfers to the UPE scheme, will no longer be eligible for thank you payments. This is in line with the changes made for new applications for thank you payments from 1 October 2024.\nClose family members refers to any of the following: spouse, civil or unmarried partners, parents, parents-in-law, sons or daughters, sons or daughters-in-law, step-sons or step-daughters, siblings, grandparents, or the spouses, civil or unmarried partners of these people.",

    "text": "Housing\nGuidance for your living arrangements 4 to 6 months after moving to the UK\nHow to rent in England\nProperty Pool Plus\nProperty Pool Plus (PPP) is the route to social housing across the 5 Liverpool City Regions of Knowsley, Halton, Wirral, Sefton and Liverpool. You need to apply to join the housing register and once your application is active you will be able to place bids on suitable properties.\nIt is important that you register for PPP as soon as you are able because the longer you have been on the register, the higher up the shortlist for a property you will be.\nDocuments you will need to apply\nYou will need to provide documents to verify your eligibility to join the scheme. As a minimum we will need a copy of your visa, passport and National Insurance Number plus proof of residency for everyone in your household.\nAvailable properties\nAvailable properties are advertised on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, we recommend that you log into your account Thursday, Sunday as all available properties will be listed for you to view. You will only see properties that you are eligible for and you can place bids on up to 3 properties per week. If your bid is successful, you will be contacted by the landlord who owns the property.\nRegister for Property Pool Plus here\nProperty websites\nThe application process and eligibility criteria is not the same as for PPP so you will need to follow the instructions the landlords provide in their adverts.\nPrivate landlords can also be found on websites such as:\nwww.rightmove.co.uk\nwww.dssmove.co.uk\nwww.spareroom.co.uk\nwww.openrent.co.uk\nhttps://www.zoopla.co.uk\n.\nIt’s often quicker to find a private rented property than wait for a social housing property due to limited availability and high demand. Check notice boards in supermarkets, small shops, newsagents, and libraries. If you use Facebook or Twitter, or any other social media, let your contacts know you are looking for a place. Ask friends or family to ask people they know or work with if they or anyone else they know has a property available to rent.\nHow long it can take to find a home\nDemand for accommodation across the Knowsley borough is exceptionally high and waiting times for accommodation vary significantly based on the needs of the applicant and their current circumstances. It is important that you apply to join PPP as soon as you can.\nIf you have not secured accommodation within 56 days of your sponsor placement coming to an end, you must approach Knowsley Housing Solutions service for expert advice on your housing situation.\nWhat Knowsley Housing Solutions can do\nYou can contact Knowsley Housing Solutions Service if you become:\nHomeless or threatened with homelessness within 56 days and\nEligible based on their immigration and residence status\nTo make a homeless presentation please\ncomplete the Knowsley Housing Solutions online presentation form\n.\nOnce you have your online presentation form, Housing Solutions will carry out an assessment with you if you are:\nHomeless or threatened with homelessness and\nEligible for help\nThe assessment will look at:\nWhy you are homeless or threatened with homelessness.\nWhat your housing needs are.\nWhat help you need to keep your current accommodation or to find alternative accommodation.\nThe homeless assessment will be given in writing. It will look at what reasonable steps you need to take and what steps Housing Solutions are expected to take. Both you and your Housing Solutions Officer will then agree a personalised housing plan (PHP) based on your homeless assessment. You will be given a copy of the assessment and a copy of your PHP.\nIf your sponsor needs you to move out\nIf your sponsor asks you to leave, if there is no other suitable sponsor available and Housing Solutions has reason to believe* you have a priority need (for example if you have children or are vulnerable), emergency accommodation will be secured while we carry out inquiries. If Housing Solutions are satisfied you are eligible and homeless, the service will take reasonable steps to help you secure accommodation.\nHousing Solutions will be mindful that you have fled your home and country because of conflict and may not have relevant documents. However they will need a copy of your visa, passport and National Insurance Number, plus proof of residency for everyone in your household.\n*‘Reason to believe is a low threshold and does not require proof.\nOther important things to consider\nFinding accommodation is part of the journey to becoming settled in your new community. You will also need to consider things like furniture and household bills so that your new tenancy is sustainable.\nTypical household bills in the UK include but are not limited to:\nRent\nCouncil tax\nUtilities (gas / electricity / water)\nTV licence\nBroadband / mobile phone\nFurniture\nCharity shops\nLike Big Help (Huyton) or Willowbrook Hospice (Prescot & Kirkby) sell donated items.\nSocial enterprises\nLike Bulky Bob's (Liverpool) offer quality second-hand furniture.\nEmergency Support Scheme\nThis scheme may be able to assist with the provision of essential furniture, up to a value of £1,000.\nTenants Extra Support Service (TESS)\nA free service funded by Knowsley Council for Knowsley residents struggling with rent arrears, debt or ill health.\nFind out more here.",

    "text": "How Property Pool Plus works\nAfter completing an application and providing supporting documents, applications are reviewed by the team and customers are then placed into a Band based on their priority. This can take up to 28 days and customers cannot make bids on properties until this is done.  A bid is an expression of interest in a vacant property being advertised. Applicants will only be considered for properties if they actively bid. This is where Property Pool Plus is different from traditional waiting lists where you apply and wait to receive an offer.\nIf a customer misses any documentation, they will be contacted to provide it, and the 28-day timeframe will start again.\nCustomer will be placed into either band A, B, C, or D.\nBand A\nApplications are put in this band when rehousing is urgently needed this is called Additional Preference and includes:\nThe applicant is homeless and in situations when councils must help.\nThere is a risk to life.\nSudden loss of home because of a disaster.\nOvercrowded by two or more bedrooms.\nUnder occupying social rented housing by two or more bedrooms.\nLife threatening or terminal medical issue.\nLeaving a stay in hospital.\nLocal Council Care Leavers.\nLocal Council approved Foster Carers who need to move to a larger home.\nArmed Forces with a housing need.\nBereaved partners of Armed Forces personnel who need to leave accommodation that is only for those who work in the Armed Services.\nWhen the applicant’s current home is needed for Regeneration, Compulsory Purchase Order, Local Council approved decant.\nHousing First programme which gives support and housing to those who are homeless or with health and care needs.\nBand B\nApplications are put in this band when rehousing is needed this is called Reasonable Preference and includes:\nWhen an applicant is Homeless for other reasons than included in Band A.\nStopping people becoming homeless.\nWhen people are living in unhealthy housing.\nOvercrowded by one bedroom.\nUnder occupying social rented housing by one bedroom.\nMedical or welfare reasons.\nHardship.\nBand C\nOther applicants who do not meet the criteria for Bands A or B this is called the General Band.\nBand D\nApplicants who have refused an allocation of social rented housing the maximum number of times.

Licences for:\na maximum of five years - may be granted to landlords who have a good track record and have shown that they will maintain good management and property standards\none year - if management arrangements or property conditions are not entirely satisfactory, or where we've had to intervene against the landlord but is not so serious as to refuse a licence, or where concerns are raised by the police or other statutory enforcement agencies.  One-year licences will also be issued to any landlords or agents operating a licensable HMO without a licence. The landlord or agent may also face prosecution.\nRefusal of a licence\nThe consequences of refusing to grant a licence are serious for both the landlord and us.   We have a duty to take on the management of the property by making an Interim Management Order.  A full option appraisal will be carried out before any decision to refuse to grant a licence is made and the making of a management order should be regarded as a last resort.  Where a proposed licence holder or manager is assessed as being not fit and proper, we will work with that person wherever possible with a view to agreeing an alternative person who is fit and proper.\nMaking an appeal\nYou may appeal if we decide to:\nrefuse a licence\ngrant a licence with conditions\nrevoke a licence\nvary a licence\nrefuse to vary a licence\nAppeals should be made to the First Tier Tribunal, normally within 28 days.

    "text": "Landlord guidance\nThe Housing Act 2004 introduced the licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) making it compulsory to licence all ‘higher-risk’ HMOs and giving powers to Councils to licence other types of ‘smaller’ HMOs to secure compliance if appropriate.\nWhat is a HMO?\nA House in multiple occupation (HMO) is defined as a building, or part of a building (for example, a flat) which:\nmore than one household lives in and shares an amenity, such as a bathroom, toilet or cooking facilities;\nis a converted building where more than one household lives and doesn't entirely comprise self-contained flats (whether or not there is also a sharing or lack of amenities); or\ncomprises entirely of converted self-contained flats and the standard of conversion does not meet, at a minimum, that required by the 1991 Building Regulations and more than one third of the flats are occupied under short tenancies, (known as Section 257 HMOs).\nAnd is 'occupied' by more than one household:\nas their only or main residence;\nas a refuge by persons escaping domestic violence;\nduring term time by students; or\nfor any other purpose as is prescribed in the regulations\nAnd the households comprise:\nfamilies (including single persons and co-habiting couples (whether or not of the opposite sex); or\nany other relationship that may be prescribed by regulations, such as domestic staff or fostering or carer arrangements\nWhy does the government want HMOs to be licensed?\nLarger HMOs, such as bedsits and shared houses, often have poorer structural integrity or facilities and management standards can often be inadequate.\nPeople who live in HMOs can be amongst the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of society. As HMOs are the only housing option for many people, the government recognises that it is vital that they are properly regulated.  Licensing is intended to make sure that:\nLandlords of HMOs (or managers who have been employed) are ‘fit and proper’\nEach HMO is suitable for occupation by the number of people permitted by the licence\nThe standard of management of the HMO is adequate\nHigh risk HMOs can be identified and targeted for improvement\nWhere landlords refuse to meet these criteria, the Council can intervene and manage the property so that:\nVulnerable tenants can be protected\nHMOs are not overcrowded\nCouncils can identify and support landlords, especially with regeneration and tackling antisocial behaviour\nDo all HMOs have to be licenced?\nNo. Under the Housing Act 2004 there are three types of licencing:\nCompulsory (required by law) licencing of HMOs for properties that are:\noccupied by five or more people in more than one household; and\nshare amenities such as bathrooms, toilets and cooking facilities\nAdditional licencing of HMOs is a discretionary power that Councils may decide to apply to a particular type of HMO, for example, two-storey properties occupied by three or more students or asylum seekers\nSelective licencing of other residential accommodation Properties that are not subject to HMO licencing could be covered under a selective licencing scheme.  This is where the Council may declare that certain areas, for example, where there is low demand for housing and/or antisocial behaviour, are appropriate for selective licencing. This licencing would cover all forms of private rented housing, including HMOs. Councils may introduce the second two types of licencing wherever they feel it is appropriate to do so. Please note that licencing only applies to HMOs where rents or other considerations are payable.\nHow does it work?\nAnyone who owns or manages a HMO that must be licenced has to apply to the Council for a licence. The Council must give a licence if it is satisfied that:\nthe HMO is reasonably suitable for occupation by the number of people allowed under the licence;\nthe proposed licence holder (and/or manager) is a fit and proper person;\nthe proposed licence holder is the most appropriate person to hold the licence;\nthe proposed management arrangements are satisfactory;\nthe person involved in the management of the HMO is competent; and\nthe financial structures for the management are suitable\nWhat does a ‘fit and proper person’ mean?\nThe Council will carry out checks to make sure that the person applying for the licence is a fit and proper person.  In deciding whether someone is fit and proper the Council must take into account:\nAny previous convictions relating to violence, sexual offences, drugs and fraud\nWhether the proposed licence holder has broken any laws relating to housing or landlord and tenant issues\nWhether the person has been found guilty of unlawful discrimination\nWhether the person has previously managed HMOs that have broken any approved code of practice.  It is advisable for the landlord or manager to be a member of a professionally recognised body, or an approved landlord’s association that is affiliated to the National Landlords Association\nWhat is in a licence?\nThe licence will specify the maximum number of people who may live in the HMO. It will also include the following conditions, which apply to every licence:\nA valid current gas safety certificate, which is renewed annually, must be provided and a valid current Electrical Installation Certificate must be provided at a minimum of every five years\nProof that all electrical appliances and furniture are kept in a safe condition\nProof that all smoke alarms are correctly positioned and installed as per the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Amendment) Regulations 2022\nEach occupier must have a written statement of the terms on which they occupy the property, for example, a tenancy agreement\nCouncils may also apply the following conditions:\nRestrictions or prohibitions on the use of parts of the HMO by occupants\nA requirement that the condition of the property, its contents, such as furniture and all facilities and amenities, bathroom and toilets for example, are in good working order\nA requirement for specified works or repairs to be carried out within a particular time frame\nA requirement that the responsible person attends an approved training course\nHow long will it last?\nA licence will normally last for a maximum of five years, although it can be for a one-year period if there are doubts over the application or how the property will be managed.\nHow much will it cost?\nLandlords will have to pay a fee to cover the administration costs of the licence procedure.  This will vary depending on the amount of time and resources that are needed to satisfy all the licencing conditions.\nCan the Council refuse to licence my property?\nYes, if the property does not meet the conditions set out above and the landlord or manager is not a fit and proper person.\nWhat will happen then?\nIf a landlord fails to bring an HMO up to the required standard or fails to meet the fit and proper person criteria, the Council can issue an Interim Management Order (IMO), which allows it to step in and manage the property. The owner keeps their rights as an owner. This order can last for a year until suitable permanent management arrangements can be made. If the IMO expires and there has been no improvement, then the Council can issue a Final Management Order. This can last up to five years and can be renewed.\nCan I appeal?\nYou may appeal if the Council decides to:\nRefuse a licence\nGrant a licence with conditions\nRevoke a licence\nVary a licence\nRefuse to vary a licence\nYou must appeal to the First Tier Tribunal, normally within 28 days.\nTemporary exemption from licencing\nIf a landlord or person in control of a property intends to stop operating it as an HMO or reduces the numbers of occupants and can give evidence of this, they can apply  for a Temporary Exemption Notice. This lasts for a maximum of three months and ensures that a property in the process of being converted from an HMO does not need to be licenced. If the situation is not resolved, then a second Temporary Exemption Notice can be issued. When this expires, the property must be licenced, become subject to an Interim Management Order, or cease to be a HMO.\nAre there any other penalties?\nIt is an offence if the landlord or person in control of the property:\nFails to apply for a licence for a licensable property; or\nAllows a property to be occupied by more people than are permitted under the licence\nA fine of up to £30,000 may be imposed. In addition, breaking any of the licence conditions can result in fines of up to £5,000.\nRent repayment orders\nA tenant living in a property that should have been licenced, but was not, can apply to the First Tier Tribunal to claim back any rent they have paid during the unlicensed period (up to a limit of 12 months).  Councils can also reclaim any housing benefit that has been paid during the time the property was without a licence.\nIt will be an HMO if it is one of the following:\nIS MY PROPERTY A HMO?\nIt will be a HMO if it is one of the following:\nHousing Act 2004 section and schedule numbers\nA shared house lived in by people who belong to more than one family* and who share one or more facilities**\nS254(2)\n(The ‘standard test’)\nA house in bedsits lived in by people who belong to more than one family* and who share one or more facilities**\nS254(4)\n(The ‘converted building test’)\nAn individual flat lived in by people who belong to more than one family* and who share one or more facilities**\nS254(3)\n(the ‘self-contained flat test’)\nA building of self-contained flats that do not meet 1991 Building Regulation Standards.\nExemptions:\nIf it is occupied by only two people\nIf it is occupied by the owner (and their family if any) and one or two lodgers\nIf it is occupied by a religious community\nIf the occupiers have their main residence elsewhere***\nIf no one in the property is required to pay rent\nIf the owner or manager is a public body\nIf the owner or manager is an educational institution\nA building of self-contained flats if two thirds or more of the flats are owner-occupied\nIf the property is part of a guest house or hotel (unless an ‘HMO Declaration’ is made)\nSch 14, 7\nSch 14, 6(c)\nSch. 14, 5\nS259, S254(2)(e)\nSch. 14, 2\nSch. 14, 4\nS257(2)(b)\n(s255(1))\nExemptions:\nIf the whole property is in self-contained flats.\nIf the basement is in commercial use and there are only two residential storeys above.\n*Family – husband, wife, co-habitee, child, step-child, foster-child, grandchild, parent, step-parent, foster-parent, grandparent, brother, half-brother, sister, half-sister, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, cousin.\n**Facilities – basic amenities: wc, wash hand basin, shower, bath: cooking facilities.\n***Accommodation use by full-time students while they are studying is taken to be their main residence.\nS258\nS254(8)\nS259(2)(a)",

    "text": "Failure to apply for a licence\nIt's a serious offence for a person having control or managing a licensable HMO to do so without a licence and without reasonable excuse. If you’re found guilty, the court can impose an unlimited fine. You may also have to pay back any rent you received during the time the property was being let but wasn’t licenced.\nWe will give the person responsible adequate opportunities to apply for a licence before we take legal action. In most cases, we will write to you inviting you to apply. This usually gives you 28 days. In some cases, this could be less, for example, if the tenant wishes to apply for a rent repayment order.\nWe will then send you a reminder letter if you do not respond. Failure to reply to this may mean that we will have to inspect the property to confirm it is licensable.\nIf we find that lack of proper management standards has put the health and safety of the occupiers at serious risk, we may take legal action without giving you further opportunity to apply. This is based on widespread publicity regarding HMO licensing,and a reasonable expectation that anyone renting out a HMO property mist also adhere to the appropriate standards and the law.\nEven if you submit an application after we take legal action but before the case comes to court, it will not be regarded as a reason to withdraw proceedings; however, it may be regarded by the Court as a mitigating factor.\nPermitting excess occupation\nThe maximum number of occupants that can live in a HMO property at any one time is agreed when we issue the licence. It is against the law to knowingly rent out a licensed HMO property to more people than agreed and is an offence punishable by an unlimited fine.\nIf the licence holder was not aware, for example, if the tenants made the arrangement without the knowledge of the licence holder, we will bring it to their attention and will give them 28 days to take appropriate action, that is, to ensure the additional occupants permanently leave the HMO during that period.\nBreach of licence conditions\nBy law, it is an offence punishable by an unlimited fine if the licence holder fails without reasonable excuse to comply with any condition of the licence.\nSerious or repeated breaches of licence conditions may also result in revocation of the licence. Legal proceedings will be considered in all cases where a licence is revoked on these grounds.\nIncomplete applications\nApplicants who have failed to provide the full details required to make their application valid will be given adequate opportunity to provide the missing information or documentation.\nWe will write to you requesting the missing information or documentation to be provided within 14 days. Failing to respond to this letter will result in the application become ineffective.\nContinued failure to cooperate may be regarded as an overall failure to apply for a licence and we may take legal action.",

    "text": "Shared Ownership\nShared ownership offers a flexible option to purchase a home, allowing you to own a portion of the property while renting the remaining share. You can typically purchase between 25% and 75% of the property's value. To finance your share, you'll obtain a mortgage and use your savings, while rent will be paid on the unowned portion. As you increase your ownership share (known as staircasing), your rent decreases.\nFor more detailed information on shared ownership, please visit the\ngovernment website.\nShared Ownership for Older Adults\nShared ownership may be available to individuals aged 55 and above who wish to downsize or seek specialised support as they age. Like standard shared ownership, you can typically buy a share between 25% and 75% of the property value, with rent paid on the remaining share. If you purchase a 75% share, you may not need to pay rent on the remaining portion. The maximum share you can typically purchase is 75% to ensure these properties remain accessible to older adults in the future.\nFor more information on Older Persons Shared Ownership, please visit\nOwn You Home's website.\nRent to Buy\nRent to Buy is a government initiative that allows you to rent a newly constructed home for a specified period, typically five years, with the option to purchase the property outright at the end of the term. Alternatively, you can pursue shared ownership before the five-year period ends, provided you meet the eligibility criteria.

If you have a programmer, set your heating and hot water to activate only when needed, rather than running continuously.\n2. Optimise water temperature\nNext time your boiler receives servicing, ask the Gas Safe engineer to adjust your water temperature to a comfortable level. This will ensure you're using hot water efficiently.\n3. Prevent heat loss\nAs dusk approaches, draw your curtains to prevent heat from escaping through windows. Additionally, check for drafts around windows and doors and seal any gaps to minimize heat loss.\n4. Switch off lights when leaving rooms\nMake a habit of turning off lights whenever you leave a room to conserve energy.\n5. Avoid standby mode\nUnplug appliances when not in use to eliminate standby power consumption. Additionally, avoid leaving laptops and mobile phones on charge unnecessarily.\n6. Optimise appliance usage\nFill up your washing machine, tumble dryer, or dishwasher whenever possible. Running one full load is more energy-efficient than two half loads. Choose the economy setting whenever available.\n7. Boil water efficiently\nOnly boil as much water as you need. When using an electric kettle, cover the elements to retain heat and reduce energy consumption.\n8. Fix dripping taps\nA dripping hot water tap not only wastes water but also consumes unnecessary energy. Repair leaking taps promptly and ensure they are fully turned off when not in use.\n9. Switch to LED bulbs\nReplace traditional incandescent bulbs with energy-efficient LED bulbs. LED bulbs last up to 10 times longer and consume significantly less energy.\n10. Explore government energy grants\nCheck if you qualify for government energy grants under the Energy Companies Obligation (ECO) scheme. These grants can provide financial assistance for home insulation or heating upgrades, improving your home's energy efficiency and reducing your fuel bills.\n11. Defrost your freezer regularly\nDefrosting your freezer regularly can significantly improve its energy efficiency. When ice buildup exceeds a quarter of an inch, it can affect the door seal's effectiveness, allowing cold air to escape and increasing energy consumption.",
