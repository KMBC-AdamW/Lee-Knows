In special circumstances, we can backdate housing benefit for up to one month for working-age claimants and three months for pension age.  You must ask us for this in writing and give us the reason why you were unable to claim earlier.\nIf you have to pay rent from your tenancy start date to the date you moved in, you may qualify for benefit before moving in. The delay in moving in must be for one of the following reasons:\nTo adapt the house if you or a member of your family have a disability.\nYou are waiting for a social fund payment to meet a need arising from the move or in connection with setting up the home; a family member must be aged five or under, or your applicable amount includes one of the following premiums: pensioner, enhanced pensioner, higher pensioner, disability, severe disability or disable child premium.\nYou became liable to make payments regarding the property while you were in hospital or a residential home.\nHowever, even when the conditions are met for two or three above, we cannot pay the benefit if you had to pay rent on a previous property immediately before the start of the tenancy at your new address. To qualify, you must apply to the council within four weeks of moving into your new home.\nSlightly different criteria apply if you are a victim of domestic violence.\nThe rules about rent before occupation are complicated.

A joint claim should instead be made for Universal Credit.\nYou cannot receive Housing Benefit and the Housing Cost element of Universal Credit for the same period.\nSpecified Accommodation residents\nTenants of certain types of Supported Accommodation will receive help with their rent from Housing Benefit, rather than Universal Credit, even if they receive Universal Credit for their other living costs.\nThis provision is restricted to accommodation, classified as 'Specified Accommodation'.\nSpecified Accommodation includes the following:\nDomestic violence refuges\nHomeless Hostels (but not self-contained properties)\nProperties owned by either Housing Associations, registered charities or voluntary organisations, and you require and receive support in your home which is more than minimal\nIn most cases, if you live in supported housing, your landlord should be able to tell you whether or not your home is classed as 'Specified Accommodation' or not.\nHowever, as a general rule, the following categories of tenants do not fall under the definition of 'Specified Accommodation':\nTenants of sheltered accommodation for over 50s\nTenants who receive low levels of support or floating support, which amounts to less than two to three hours per week\nAlternatively, you can call the council directly on 0151 443 4042 for further advice or guidance on this matter.",

    "text": "Managed migration explained\nManaged migration is where the Government moves you on to Universal Credit from another benefit even if your circumstances have not changed. This process started on a small scale in 2022 only affecting some areas nationally. However this is now progressing steadily, and it is expected that most people in receipt of a legacy benefit (Income Support, Income-based Jobseekers Allowance, Income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Child Tax Credit, Working Tax Credit, Housing Benefit) will be moved over to Universal Credit by the end of December 2025. The last benefit being moved is Income-Related Employment and Support Allowance.\nAs part of the Managed Migration process, the Government is writing to people inviting them to claim Universal Credit. The letter is called a Migration Notice. It's happening in stages depending on which legacy benefit you receive.\nOnce you have you received your letter\nThe Department for Works and Pension will be sending Migration Notices to Knowsley residents over the coming months depending on what legacy benefit you are currently receiving.\nWhen you do get this letter, do not ignore it. You must claim Universal Credit because your legacy benefit will stop after three months of the date of the letter. If you are late in making this claim you will lose any entitlement to \"Transitional Protection\". Transitional Protection is the difference between your existing entitlement and your entitlement to UC. If you were better off on your existing benefit and you claim UC before the deadline then you should be no worse off when you move to UC. If you make your claim for UC after the 3-month deadline then you will not be paid your Transitional Protection.\nIf you are living in rented accommodation and receive care, support or supervision as part of your tenancy or you are living in temporary homeless accommodation you will continue to claim Housing Benefit to support with your rent costs.\nYou have to\nclaim Universal Credit online\n(or, you can claim it over the phone in limited circumstances)\nMore information is available from the\nUnderstanding Universal Credit website\n.\nHelp with your claim\nThere are 2 ways to get help with your Universal Credit claim. You can either call the Universal Credit helpline or use the Help to claim service.\nCalls to the Universal Credit helpline are free.\nUniversal Credit helpline\nTelephone\n0800 328 5644\nWelsh language\n0800 328 1744\nRelay UK\n(if you cannot hear or speak on the phone)\n18001 then 0800 328 5644\nOther methods\nBritish Sign Language (BSL)\nvideo relay service\nif you’re on a computer\nFind out how to\nuse the service on mobile or tablet\nTextphone\n0800 328 1344\nMonday to Friday, 8am to 6pm\nFind out about call charges\nHelp to Claim\nYou can get free support from trained advisers to make a Universal Credit claim.

This might take place at any point within a six-year period of receiving the grant.\nAdditionally, at the end of each funding period, a selection of projects will be selected for full audit.\nKnowsley Council has a zero-tolerance approach to fraud/corruption.",

They invent a fictitious landlord and use false rent books and tenancy agreements\nFalse address or failing to declare a change of address - the claimant is claiming benefit for an address where they do not live\nLandlord fraud – where a landlord continues to receive benefits paid directly to themselves when they know that the claimant has left the premises\nFictitious tenancies - where a tenancy is created between friends or family, where the property would not usually be rented, to obtain benefits to which they are not entitled",

    "text": "In 2013, the Government implemented new rules. These rules state that you will receive housing benefit based on one bedroom for each person or couple living as part of the household. There are some exceptions.\nThe rules only apply to people of working age claiming housing benefit. They do not apply to pensioners who have reached the qualifying age for pension credit.\nChildren under 16 of the same gender are expected to share a bedroom.\nChildren under 10 are expected to share a bedroom regardless of their gender.\nA disabled tenant or partner needing a non-resident overnight carer will be allowed an extra room.\nExamples\nA couple with two girls aged five and 15 will be treated as needing two bedrooms. From April 2013, if they live in a three bedroom home their housing benefit will be reduced.\nA single parent with a seven year old boy and nine year old girl will be treated as needing two bedrooms. From April 2013, if they live in a three-bedroom home their housing benefit will be reduced.\nThe changes affect you if you are of working age and are treated as having at least one spare bedroom. This includes the following.\nSeparated parents who share the care of their children and who may have been allocated an extra bedroom for this. Under benefit rules, there must be just one ‘main carer’ for children – if you are not the main carer, your benefit will be reduced.\nCouples who don’t share the same bedroom – the second bedroom will be treated as a spare bedroom.\nFoster carers – the bedroom they use for any foster children will be treated as a spare bedroom. This is because foster children are not counted as part of the household for benefit purposes.\nIf you have one ‘spare’ bedroom, the rent we use to calculate your housing benefit reduced by 14%. This was to equal to about £12 a week (£624 a year).\nIf you have two or more ‘spare’ bedrooms, the rent we use to calculate your housing benefit reduced by 25%. This was equal to about £22 a week (£1,144 a year).\nWhat if your housing benefit payments don’t cover your rent\nIf you think your housing benefit will be reduced because you have one or more ‘spare’ bedrooms, you need to start planning for the change now.\nTo avoid falling into arrears, you will have to use other money to pay your landlord the shortfall. If you are worried you won’t be able to pay any shortfall in your rent, contact your landlord.",
