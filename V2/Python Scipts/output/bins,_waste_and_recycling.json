This is under section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990\nIf your waste is found illegally fly tipped, you could be held responsible and prosecuted.\nTips on how to comply with your waste duty of care\nCheck that the company you are using to remove your waste is registered with the Environment Agency.\nYou can do this by calling 03708 506506 or visiting their website.\nAsk the company to see their registration certificate.\nThis should start with CBDU, followed by a set of numbers. Take a photo of the certificate if possible.\nDo not pay cash.\nAsk for an invoice or receipt that includes the business details and pay by a secure payment method or cheque. This will make it easier to trace the payment if your waste is fly tipped.\nRecord the details of the person collecting your waste and the vehicles used.\nThis includes the make, model, colour, and registration mark.\nBe wary of companies that offer their services at a very low price.\nIf it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If you’re hiring a skip, the average cost should be around £150\nWaste carrier registration\nA waste carrier registration is normally needed for the following categories\nAll building and associated trades\nLandscape gardeners, tree fellers and surgeons\nHouse clearers\nRetail establishments and\nScrap metal dealers\nUsing private contractors\nIf you hire a private contractor to collect household, garden, or construction waste, ensure they're registered with the Environment Agency and hold a waste carrier's licence. Failure to do so could result in an unlimited fine.\nBusinesses\nBusinesses have additional responsibilities under the waste duty of care. In addition to the tips above, you must also\nProvide an accurate description of the waste when it is transferred to another person.\nKeep all records for a minimum of two years.\nFailure to comply with the waste duty of care requirements is a criminal offence and could lead to prosecution.\nKnowsley Household Recycling and Waste Centres\nAlternatively, residents can dispose of their waste at Knowsley’s two Household Recycling and Waste Centres run by the Merseyside Recycling and Waste Authority.\nFind out more information\nhere.",
