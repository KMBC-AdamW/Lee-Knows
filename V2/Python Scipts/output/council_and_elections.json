If you still can’t find it, you can use the HMRC enquiry service.\nHMRC won't tell you your National Insurance number over the phone. They will post the information to you.\nIf you don't know your date of birth\nIf you do not know your actual date of birth, you may have been given an official one in the past, which can be used to register to vote. This can be found on a passport, adoption certificate, driving licence or naturalisation certificate.\nIf you do not have one, you must explain why you cannot provide it in your registration application. We may contact you to ask you for other proof of identity.",

For employees and councillors, this will mean payroll and expense data is provided to the Cabinet Office.\nThe initiative is a data-matching exercise which involves comparing records held by one body against other records held by the same or another body to see if they match. This is usually personal information. This data matching allows potentially fraudulent activity, claims, and payments to be identified. Where a match is found, it may indicate that there is an inconsistency that requires further investigation by the council.\nThe use of data by the Cabinet Office in a data matching exercise is carried out with statutory authority under Part 6 of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014. It does not require the consent of the individuals concerned under data protection legislation or the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).\nThe council is committed to combating fraud wherever it may be found. It is determined to eliminate fraud by those who attempt to obtain money or services from the council to which they are not entitled. In doing so, it will share information provided to it with other bodies responsible for auditing or administering public funds in order to prevent and detect fraud.\nYou can read more about the Cabinet Office's\ndata matching process\nand\ncode of practice\n.",

    "text": "The LGA Peer Challenge process includes a review of the following:\nLocal priorities and outcomes – considering the clarity of the Council’s priorities and their relationship to the local context.\nOrganisational and place leadership – considering the effectiveness of the Council’s local leadership, including the relationships with partner agencies and communities.\nGovernance and culture – considering the clarity and robustness of the Council’s governance arrangements, including a culture of respect, challenge, and scrutiny.\nFinancial planning and management – considering the Council’s current financial position and the Council’s strategy and plans to address financial challenges.\nCapacity for improvement – considering whether the organisation can support the delivery of local priorities and has the capacity to improve as appropriate.\nThe\nfeedback report from the re-visit undertaken in December 2021 can be viewed here\n. In summary, the review team acknowledged that:\nThe Council has a good understanding of its communities.\nThe value of the Knowsley Better Together approach (bringing people and organisations together for the benefit of Knowsley and its communities) and commended the Council for their induction process by introducing the “Knowsley Better Together Journey”.\nThe Council has taken brave decisions regarding investments to stimulate the economy.\nThe Council has made progress in developing the Council’s leadership and culture (which was well illustrated through the Council’s effective response to COVID-19) and the joint work which took place with partner agencies and voluntary and community organisations.\nThe Council continues to have strong financial management in place.\nAs expected, the Peer Challenge team made several recommendations for the Council to consider, which focus on taking Knowsley Better Together “to the next level” by embedding the principles into the Knowsley Council Plan 2022-2025 and further developing community engagement and empowerment.\nAn action plan has been developed to progress these recommendations. You can view the action plan\nhere\n.\nThe team conducted a further re-visit to monitor progress against the Council’s action plan. You can\nread the progress review report here\n, but in summary, the team noted:\nThe pandemic has resulted in staff and communities feeling more empowered, which should continue progressing\nKnowsley Better Together (bringing people and organisations together for the benefit of Knowsley and its residents) has been instrumental in the management of COVID-19.\nExtensive consultation has been undertaken over the Summer to find out from communities what they need to thrive and not just survive. The results have shaped the Knowsley Offer, launched in February 2023 and outlines the help and support available to residents, addressing their key priorities.\nThe Council has developed a Stronger Communities Strategy, which focuses on growing community capacity and supporting more people to be active within their communities so that people can help themselves, each other and their neighbourhoods.\nA Leadership Programme is being developed for the six local authorities across the Liverpool City Region (Halton, Knowsley, Liverpool, St Helens, Sefton and Wirral Councils), strengthening partnership arrangements and providing greater opportunities for people working in the Liverpool City Region.\nThe Council Plan for 2022-2025 has been approved, which focuses on effective support for those in need, inclusive skills and growth and climate emergency and achieving net zero.\nThe Council has been raising the profile of the Borough by attracting media attention for projects such as the opening of the Shakespeare North Playhouse, along with media coverage generated related to the Council’s Levelling Up Fund bids.\nFor further information on the Corporate Peer Challenge, contact Melanie Duncan via email at\nmelanie.duncan@knowsley.gov.uk\nor by telephone at 0151 443 5824.",

This means that we have to demonstrate that in decision-making processes we have shown due regard to the need to:\neliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and any other conduct prohibited by the Act;\nadvance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and people who do not share it; and\nfoster good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and people who do not share it.\nThese are the three aims of the general equality duty. Having due regard for advancing equality involves:\nRemoving or minimising disadvantages suffered by people due to their protected characteristics.\nTaking steps to meet the needs of people from protected groups where these are different from the needs of other people.\nEncouraging people from protected groups to participate in public life or in other activities where their participation is disproportionately low.\nOur Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Objectives for 2021-2025 are:\nAchieve Disability Confident Level 2\nReduce our Gender Pay Gap\nAchieve the Navajo Charter Mark\nFulfil our Race Equality Declaration of Intent\nEquality & Diversity Four-Year Progress Report 2012 - 2016\nEquality & Diversity Four-Year Report\nEquality & Diversity Policy Statement 2022 - 2025\nEquality & Diversity Policy Statement 2022 - 2025\nRace Equality - Declaration of Intent\nRace Equality - Declaration of Intent\nEquality Communications Guidance\nEquality Communications Guidance\nWorkforce profile\nThe Workforce Profile helps the Council meet the requirements of The Equality Act 2010, General Equality Duty to:\nEliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation;\nAdvance equality of opportunity and\nFoster good relations\nThe Workforce Profile is a valuable resource to help monitor the workforce and provide year-on-year benchmarking information to assist workforce planning.

    "text": "Scrutiny is in place for the benefit of the community at large.  It is designed to support and enhance decision-making processes.  Scrutiny involves non-executive elected members reviewing and scrutinising the whole range of the council’s functions and responsibilities, including those delivered in partnership with other agencies and organisations.\nScrutiny aims to make a positive impact on the economic, social and environmental well-being of those who live, work and visit the borough of Knowsley by supporting the development of policy, monitoring performance, and making important recommendations to support improvement.\nHow scrutiny is structured in Knowsley\nScrutiny in Knowsley consists of five themed committees, each with its own areas of responsibility that have been aligned with the priorities of the Council’s Corporate Plan. The five Scrutiny committees are;\nChildren\nHealth and Adult Social Care\nInclusive Growth and Skills\nStronger Communities\nClimate Emergency\nEach committee is responsible for coordinating its activity and ensuring it meets its obligations.  They each comprise of Elected Members, with both the Children Scrutiny Committee and the Health and Adult Social Care Scrutiny Committee also having co-opted Members who serve on the committees alongside the elected members.\nHow scrutiny works\nAt the beginning of the municipal year, opinions are sought from elected Members, officers, partners and members of the public for suggestions of topics/ areas that they feel would benefit from being ‘scrutinised.’\nThe list of suggestions is then taken to a work-planning session involving all elected Members, who then select one area/ topic for each committee that will be the subject of an in-depth review.\nEach committee will meet four times yearly in addition to the chosen task and finish review activity.\nTask and finish reviews\nA task and finish review involves committee members carrying out activity away from the formal setting of a committee meeting to tackle issues head-on, gathering evidence to inform findings and recommendations to be included in a final review report. This could involve working group sessions, site visits and surveys/ questionnaires. After they are finalised, review reports are then taken to Cabinet for consideration and to seek approval of action to be taken forward in response to its recommendations.\nTask and Finish Reports\nChildren Scrutiny Committee Task and Finish Review into Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) Provision\nHealth and Adult Social Care Scrutiny Committee Task and Finish Review into Respite Services Final Report\nInclusive Growth and Skills Scrutiny Committee Task and Finish Review into Strategic Housing\nStronger Communities Scrutiny Committee Task and Finish Review into Creating a Volunteer Network\nScheduled committee meetings\nCommittee meetings provide the opportunity for Members to look at other topics, to receive reports on the progress being made on tackling issues and to be consulted on decisions due to be made or draft policies/ strategies.\nIndividual committees can decide to include in their work plan for the year topics not selected to be the subject of a task and finish review.  These topics would then be included as items on scheduled committee agendas.\nScheduled committee meetings can also be used as a platform for holding decision-makers (council and partners) to account for what they have done. You can find out more information on committee structures\nhere\n.\nAnnual Report\nView the Scrutiny Annual Report for 2023/24\n.\nGetting involved\nIf you are interested and would like to get more involved or make suggestions for future issues to be considered by Scrutiny, please write to us at:\nScrutiny and Partnership Team, Municipal Buildings, Archway Road, Huyton, L36 9Y\nOr email:\nscrutiny@knowsley.gov.uk",

    "text": "Multi Faith and Belief Workers' Group\nMFAB is a welcoming and caring community of people who value faith and belief in the workplace, and meet to explore and express these values and provide opportunities for others to do so.\nWe aim to celebrate and increase the appreciation of faith and belief in the workplace and offer support and community to colleagues who have a personal faith or who are seeking to explore or express their beliefs.\nWhere necessary, to challenge prejudice and inappropriate behaviour in relation to faith and belief in the workplace.\nWomen's Operational Workers' Group\nWoW provides a supportive community where women can share experiences, access resources, and find solidarity. WoW work with the Council to ensure women’s voices are heard and celebrated. The group also promotes International Women's Day/Women’s History Month.\nIt provides advice and guidance which contributes to the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion agenda of Knowsley Council, particularly as women make up over 70% of the total workforce.\nWe run regular Menopause café’s where those experiencing menopause can gain support and access information and work with Organisational Development to deliver a women’s Empowerment Programme in order to reduce the Gender Pay Gap.\nDisability Workers' Group\nThe Disability Workers’ Group (DWG) promotes equality for disabled employees within the workplace.  It works in an advisory and consultation role for the council, ensuring new and existing policies are appropriate for disabled people in Knowsley.  The group is also a source of advice and support.\nThe group aims to raise the profile of disability issues in the council and supports employees who identify as having a disability to make a lasting difference.\nThe DWG provides a forum to discuss disability-related issues and influence change in a positive fashion.\nNeurodiversity Support Group\nThe Neurodiversity Support group is a forum for colleagues to talk about neurodiversity topics, such as Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia and more.\nThe group meet every other month in Huyton on the second Thursday of the month.\nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Forum\nThe Knowsley Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Forum offers support and encouragement to employees who wish to join or contribute to their activities. One of the main aims of the group is to increase the profile of the council as an employer which is supportive of its LGBTQ+ workers, where their contribution to the council is celebrated and valued as part of a diverse workforce.\nThe group acts as a consultation forum for new policies and strategies and hopes to influence change and open a two-way process for exchanging ideas, problem-solving, and information sharing. It assists employees with development and empowerment and aims to raise awareness and reduce discrimination within the workplace.\nBlack, Asian and Minority Workers' Group\nThe Black, Asian and Minority Workers' Group aims to influence cultural change, promote respect and value of cultural diversity within Knowsley.\nThe group provides an overview of issues and concerns, and identifies improvements in polices, practices and strategies. Operating as Black, Asian and Minority Workers Collective, it challenges all forms of discrimination, racial harassment and bullying while promoting race equality in employment and the delivery of services.\nThe group aims to work towards equality and diversity through an alliance with other Black, Asian & Minority Workers networks. It forms an alliance with other Knowsley Council issue worker groups and other black and minority worker groups regionally and nationally, and to contribute to the establishment of a black and minority worker network for empowerment and change.\nBelow are examples of what the group gets involved in:\nOffer support and encouragement to employees who wish to join or contribute to the activities of the group\nAssist with employee development and empowerment\nEngage in and promote networking opportunities with other councils and organisations at a local, regional and national level\nKnowsley Council Carer's Forum\nThe Knowsley Council Carer's Forum aims to offer support staff who are carers.  This includes providing advice and support for employees with caring responsibilities, signposting to information for carers which will encourage a culture towards supporting carers in and into work; and promoting the retention of staff who are or may become carers.\nYouth Employee Network\nThe Youth Employee Network was established in April 2024, as a space for young employees to:\nLearn - from one another but also senior officers and guest speakers\nConnect - with one another and build a network of peers across the council\nFeel Empowered - a space where members have a voice across the organisation\nThe group meets once a month and meetings can vary widely, from challenging organisational policies to networking or learning events. One of the highlights is our “Mystery Manager” series, where a senior officer attends and discusses their area service, their career journey and their development ‘top tips’. This allows members to learn from senior officers and allows us to have a deeper understanding of the different services within the council.\nThe Changies\nThe Changies is a men's support group , where Knowsley Council workers can have a safe space to discuss issues, share experiences and seek support. Based on the idea of the footy ‘changies’, the group is a chance to make new friends and contacts, have a laugh and help others.",

    "text": "Over a prolonged period of time, concerns have been raised with the Council over large commercial vehicles causing obstructive and indiscriminate parking and therefore causing safety concerns for pedestrians, as well as access and egress issues for vehicles accessing premises on Moss End Way, Woodward Road and Acornfield Road, Kirkby. As a result, the Council is receiving an increased number of complaints regarding inconsiderate, obstructive, and dangerous parking within the area. These inconsiderately parked vehicles also increase the risk of head on collisions taking place.\nWhat is proposed?\nThe Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO) will deliver mitigations to manage obstructive and indiscriminate on-street parking on Moss End Way, Woodward Road and Acornfield Road, Kirkby, by way of introducing Red Route (no stopping at any time) restrictions.\nThe Experimental Traffic Regulation Order will include;\nIntroduction of Red Route (No stopping at any time) restrictions, prohibiting vehicles from stopping at any time within the parameters of the Red Route.\nProviding a safer route for cyclists and pedestrians.\nImproved access and egress for vehicles accessing premises on Moss End Way, Woodward Road and Acornfield Road.\nDocuments\nDocument\nMoss End Way Proposal Plan.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n333.34KB\n)\nThe above-mentioned scheme will be introduced on a trial basis via an Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO) which will be implemented and enforced over the coming weeks and will be in place for a maximum period of 18 months.\nHave your say\nDuring the first six months of the Experimental Traffic Order, we actively invite you to provide your comments and feedback to us. This will give the Council the opportunity to consider your views and in doing so, help us decide whether to make changes to the scheme, make the scheme permanent or withdraw the scheme, and revert to the existing situation.\nPlease send your views and feedback to\nHighway.Consultations@knowsley.gov.uk\nand entitle your email Moss End Way ETRO by Monday 19th May 2025.\nHow will the scheme be enforced?\nThe proposed order will be enforced by the Council’s team of Civil Enforcement Officers. It should be noted that Penalty Charge Notices (PCN’s) can be issued instantly as no observation period is required with No Stopping at Any Time / Red Route orders, which will further deter abuse of the restriction. It should also be noted that postal PCNs will also be issued to vehicle drive always or on occasions where the PCN cannot be physically handed to the driver or affixed to the vehicle.",

Currently, there is no pedestrian crossing facility outside the shops.\nAfter reviewing the road layout, traffic flow, and the number of pedestrians crossing, it is proposed that two Zebra crossing facilities at either end of the shops are the most suitable solution and should be implemented.\nThe pedestrianised crossing will be located approximately 113 metres and 175 metres east of its junction with St Johns Road. This allows for access to the shops on the north side and houses on the south side of Manor Farm Road.\nWhat is proposed?\nThe scheme will improve sustainable choices for travelling to local employment, education, retail, health, and recreation facilities. Walking can make a very positive contribution to improving health and tackling obesity, improving accessibility, tackling congestion, reducing carbon emissions and improving the local environment.\nDocuments\nDocument\nHP018-Statutory Consultation - Manor Farm Road.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n346.31KB\n)\nDocument\n20939-WAT-HGN-103-DR-D-950101 P04-Consultation.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n503.92KB\n)\nHave your say\nYour views on the proposals are important to us.

    "text": "Following on from the consultation last year, work is about to commence on an Active Travel and Capacity Improvement Scheme on Moorgate Road and the East Lancashire Road (A580) providing a fit for purpose, high quality, resilient network for the future.\nThe improvements will be delivered in two phases. Phase one, relating to Moorgate Road and the East Lancashire Road, is scheduled to commence in early 2025. This phase will commence from 24th to 28th of February.\nFurther details relating to the start of this phase, including road diversions that will be in place, can be viewed in the below information sheets.\nDocument\nInfo Sheet 1 - Site Establishment.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.01MB\n)\nDocument\nInfo Sheet 2 - A580 onto Moorgate Road North.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.28MB\n)\nDocument\nInfo Sheet 3 - Moorgate Road and East Lancashire Road Emergency info sheet.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n885.42KB\n)\nDocument\nInfo Sheet 4 - Moorgate Road and East Lancashire Road.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n998.94KB\n)\nPhase two, relating to Junction 4 of the M57 will commence in the summer of 2026. Full details of work to be undertaken within each phase can be viewed by clicking below.\nView details of the planned work here\nThe works will include:\nImprovements at the junction of Moorgate Road and East Lancashire Road (A580), with new separate cycle crossings constructed to improve the safety of cyclists whilst making their journey through the junction quicker and more efficient.\nA reduction in the speed limit of the East Lancashire Road from 50mph to 40mph between Alchemy Way and the boundary with Liverpool.\nImprovements for cyclists and pedestrians at Ribblers Lane, making it safer and easier to join up to existing cycle routes.\nCarriageway widening to create extra lanes and increase capacity and reduce congestion at both junctions.\nThe full signalisation of Junction 4 of the M57 and upgrading the existing signals at Moorgate Road Junction East Lancashire Road (A580).\nAll works will involve resurfacing, drainage and street lighting improvements where appropriate.\nM57 Frequently asked questions\nFrequently asked questions\nI am a driver, what are the benefits for me?\nThe improvements to the traffic signals will ease long term congestion as well as providing immediate benefits for non-motorised users. However, the other improvements will not just benefit cyclists and pedestrians, but all road users including children, less-able individuals and people making short trips around their community. These high-quality facilities will encourage non-motorised transport where possible and reduce congestion for those that need to use their vehicles.\nWhy is this happening?\nWe want to provide better links around Kirkby that reduce congestion for motor vehicles and encourage healthier and more varied modes of travel. Making non-motorised forms of transportation safer, more efficient, and more attractive makes local amenities, businesses, and places of work more accessible while reducing congestion on the highway for journeys that are made by car. This scheme supports the central government objective to provide better, sustainable transport links.\nWhat is the evidence base for this work?\nThere is wide public support for schemes of this type, 76% of Liverpool City Region residents think space should be increased for socialising, cycling, and walking on high streets and 61% believe that more should be invested in cycling and walking facilities. There are 300 million journeys under three miles long undertaken by car each year in the Liverpool City Region, most of these journeys could be undertaken without the use of a motor vehicle. However, around 75% of residents believe that cycling safety needs to be improved, and 63% believe that fewer motor vehicles on the roads would encourage them to cycle more.\nThis scheme seeks to attract non-motorised users (such as cyclists) by providing safer, more efficient facilities and because 76% of residents believe that cycle routes that are physically protected from traffic and pedestrians would encourage them to cycle more, we believe this scheme will have broad positive effects, in both attracting new users and making Kirkby more accessible using any form of transport.\nHow do you know that the junction upgrades will reduce congestion in the future?\nWe have undertaken extensive transportation modelling of the area; our models look at the existing infrastructure and traffic data and the effects of the expected developments and growth up to 2035. By comparing different scenarios, we have found that the proposal to upgrade the Moorgate Road Junction of East Lancashire Road provides the most robust solution and ensures that the junctions remain below capacity into the future.\nWhy is Road Tax / Council Tax funding new infrastructure for bikes and pedestrians?\nVehicle Excise Duty (the official name for road tax) does not fund infrastructure upgrades, and these works are not being funded by Council Tax.\nWho is paying for these works?\nThe main contributor for these works is central government via the City Region Sustainable Transport Settlement (CRSTS).\nThere are other projects we should be spending the money on…\nThe road network is used by a broad cross-section of society, and everyone has their own priorities. The funding obtained from central government for this scheme focuses on; relieving congestion, improving sustainable travel facilities and promoting economic growth.\nIf you have ideas or proposals for new projects, we are always happy to hear from you via our\nHighwaysEnquiries@knowsley.gov.uk\ninbox.\nHow will the construction works affect my day-to-day life?\nBoth phases will remain open at most times. There may be times when a road needs to be closed, but this will be done at a time that minimises disruption, such as at night. Full closures will be limited, and residents will be informed in advance of any closures. The road will remain open although at times we may need to install temporary traffic signals to facilitate the works safely.\nAccess to and from businesses and domestic properties will always be provided for all road users.\nWhy cannot cyclists ride on the road or footpath?\nCyclists move at different speeds to pedestrians and motor vehicles; on the road they are vulnerable to motorists and can cause issues for pedestrians on the footpath. Pedestrians, cyclists and motorists are three different forms of travel, each with their own requirements. Providing dedicated facilities along high-capacity routes improves efficiency and safety for all users.\nHow long will the construction take?\nThe works will be phased to minimise disruption, Phase 1 (Moorgate Road junction of East Lancashire Road) will take around twelve months. Initially the works will be focused on the Northwest side of the junction and work downwards towards the Southwest side of the scheme.\nPhase 2 (M57 Junction 4 roundabout) will start in 2026. You will be notified of the scheme with regards to start date and duration before construction starts. At this time, the duration of phase 2 is to be confirmed.\nHow can I contact the project team?\nPlease contact us via email at\nHighwaysEnquiries@knowsley.gov.uk\nor in writing at the address below:\nKnowsley Council\nStretton Way Depot\nStretton way\nHuyton\nKnowsley\nL36 6JF\nWho will benefit from this project?\nThere will be benefits for all road and non-motorised users. The upgraded junction will provide additional crossing facilities for non-motorists and additional capacity on the road. Providing quality cycle facilities can further reduce vehicles on the road, improving local air quality and easing congestion. For the residents of Kirkby, there will be better quality access in and around the community which does not require a motor vehicle.\nWill electric bikes (EAPCs) or e-scooters be able to use the new cycle facilities?\nKnowsley is not presently host to any e-scooter trials, so e-scooters are not permitted for use on any roads Knowsley.\nEAPCs, electrically assisted pedal cycles, can be used anywhere that a normal pedal bike can be used. They may be used in the cycleway providing the rider and the EAPC meets the legal requirements which can be found on the\ngov.uk website EAPC pages\n.",

    "text": "For many years concerns have been raised with the Council over the amount of school related traffic using Marina Crescent and adjacent roads during drop-off and pick-up times. This increases the risks of collisions between motorised traffic and vulnerable road users as well as with other vehicles.\nThe associated parking on the roads makes it difficult for other vehicles to pass, and causes visibility issues for children wanting to cross, whilst the pavement parking makes it dangerous and at times forces children to walk in the road.\nFurthermore, local residents have for a long-time experienced problems arising from anti-social and dangerous parking during school drop-off and pick-up times with people parking across their driveways and even driving along the pavement.\nWe have listened to the comments received during the last consultation in 2023 and are introducing a new scheme that will improve the active travel links in the area whilst addressing the safety concerns that were expressed by reducing traffic around Marina Crescent, Ruskin Way and Cedar Crescent during school opening times.\nProposed new footpath\nIt is also proposed to create a new footpath from Twickenham Drive to the rear of St Anne’s School. This will enable more people to walk or wheel to school from that estate and reduce the need to travel by vehicle.\nPlease note that this will be subject to a planning application.\nThe enclosed leaflet shows two potential locations for a new footpath. We would welcome feedback on whether option one or two is preferred before submitting the planning application.\nIf you have a preference, please contact us via email at\nschoolstreets@knowsley.gov.uk\nbefore 31st March 2025.\nDocuments\nDocument\nSchool Streets Booklet.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.71MB\n)\nDocument\nSchool Streets FAQs.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n458.33KB\n)\nDocument\nSchool Streets Plan - March 2025.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n467.81KB\n)\nWalk to School Week\nBefore the scheme is designed and introduced, a specific walk to school week will take place from the week commencing 24th March (Monday to Friday).\nAs part of this initiative Marina Crescent, Ruskin Way and Cedar Crescent will be closed at school opening and closing times (8.00 to 9.00 and 14.15 to 15.30) to replicate the proposed scheme. By undertaking a walk to school week, it will give the Highways Team an understanding of how the proposed ban of motor vehicles will operate and what may need to be considered in the project design.\nFurther information\nFor more information on School Streets please visit\nSchool Streets Initiative - All the information you need\nTo watch a video about real life examples please visit\nActive Travel: The Art of the Possible",

This includes going to work, school or the shops. The LCWIP sets out the council’s long-term plans to enable growth in active travel routes across Knowsley.\nThe plan links in with the wider Liverpool City Region and will support the Council in its Net Zero objectives through the creation of greener, safer and healthier communities.\nCllr Tony Brennan, Knowsley Council Cabinet Member for Regeneration and Economic Development, said: “This consultation on our proposed Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan is a major milestone in helping to coordinate our existing schemes, those proposed by the City Region, such as Prescot to Runcorn and East Lancashire Road routes, as well as those of our neighbouring Boroughs.  The plan aims to support the design and delivery of effective walking and cycling networks for all communities across Knowsley.\n“It is important that residents have an opportunity to comment and share their local knowledge and expertise to help inform this plan.

    "text": "Elections 2025\nThere are no scheduled elections taking place in Knowsley in May 2025.  This is because Knowsley Borough Council is comprised of 45 Councillors with one-third elected “three years in four”.  This means that one-third of the Councillors are elected each year for three consecutive years and the fourth year is a “fallow year” with no scheduled local elections.\n2025 is a ‘fallow year’ and therefore the next scheduled election will take place on Thursday, 7 May 2026.\nOur known election schedule for the next five years is:\n2025\nFallow year\n2026\nLocal elections\n2027\nLocal elections\nParish elections\n2028\nLocal elections\nPolice and Crime Commissioner election\nLiverpool City Region Mayor election\n2029\nFallow year\n*also the latest date a General Election can be held\nPostal vote applications\nThe Election Act 2022 has made several changes regarding applying for a postal vote.\nAs a result of the changes;\nAll postal voters who completed a postal vote application form before 31 October 2023 must renew their postal vote application no later than 31 January 2026.\nWhen applying for a postal vote, you must prove your identity by providing your national insurance number, date of birth, and valid signature (exceptions apply).\nAll postal voters must reapply for a postal vote every three years (it was previously every five years).\nYou are now allowed to apply for a postal vote online.\nThose wishing to apply for a postal vote online can do so at  www.gov.uk/apply-postal-vote\nRemember, to complete your application, you will need:\nYour National Insurance number\nYour date of birth\nAn image/ photograph of your signature written in black ink on plain white paper (it is easier to have this prepared and a photograph of it saved on your phone).\nElectors who would rather complete a paper form can request that one be sent to them by contacting the elections team on 0151 443 2222 or via email\nelections@knowsley.gov.uk\nAs a result of these changes, on Monday, 31 March 2025, the Knowsley elections team sent emails to all registered postal voters who had previously provided an email address, encouraging them to re-apply before the deadline of 31 January 2026. A reminder email is planned to be sent around Wednesday, 14 May 2025.\nLetters will be posted to all other registered postal voters and those who didn’t respond to either of the emails later in the summer (date to be confirmed).\nFurther information on postal voting and the Elections Act is available from the\nElectoral Commission\n.",
