You can read more about installing EV charge points on their website here -\nCharging electric vehicles - Energy Saving Trust\nWhat is your advice when charging an electric vehicle?\nThe Highway Code offers this advice;\n“When using an electric vehicle charge point, you should park close to the charge point and avoid creating a trip hazard for pedestrians from trailing cables. Display a warning sign if you can. After using the charge point, you should return charging cables and connectors neatly to minimise the danger to pedestrians and avoid creating an obstacle for other road users.”\nI don't have a driveway - what are my options for charging an electric vehicle?\nAt present EV charging cables trailing across or under the public highway are prohibited.

    "summary": "",
    "intro": "",
    "text": "EV Myths\nThere are a lot of misconceptions and myths surrounding electric vehicle and electric vehicle charging points.\nHere are just a few.\nEV Battery Myths\nBattery myths\nEV Batteries Fail\nFalse.\nEVs are sold with an 8-year, 100,000 miles battery warranty that covers all types of failure should this happen to your vehicle. However, this is unlikely to happen at all.\nEV Batteries Could Create a Global Toxic Hazard\nFalse.\nThe truth is EV batteries are far too valuable to simply be thrown away. Instead, these batteries are sent to specialised recycling facilities and broken down into their core components, most of which are ‘infinitely recyclable’.\nEV Batteries Have a Short Range\nFalse.\nRange anxiety is one of the leading issues surrounding EVs. However, these anxieties are unfounded. Some EVs currently available have a maximum range of 450 miles in a singular charge, almost double the mileage of the average weekly driver.\nEV Batteries Will Run Out During Traffic Jams\nFalse.\nWith Range anxiety rife, other questions have arisen, including the worry of an EVs ability to outlast a traffic jam. An understandable worry, however unlike a petrol or diesel vehicle, an EV uses considerably little power.\nEV Charging Myths\nCharging myths\nThere Aren’t Enough Chargers\nFalse.\nWhile it is true that a larger infrastructure will be needed to support the increasing interest in EVs, as of May 2024, the UK already boasts 61,000 charging points according to\nZapMaps\n, with a rolling 50% year on year increase. This means an average of 1,100 new installations per month.\nEVs Take Too Long to Charge\nFalse.\nIt is true that charging an EV will take longer than filling up a petrol or diesel vehicle, however it is important to consider how and when EVs are charged.\nThe majority of EVs are charged at home, or via street charging points overnight, while the driver is asleep. This provides the vehicle with 6-12 hours of charging and more than enough energy to sustain the average driver for a whole week. Moreover, ultra-rapid charging points can add 100 miles to your EV within 15 minutes.\nThe National Grid Can’t Cope\nFalse.\nAs it stands the National Grid can and is coping with the amount of EVs currently in circulation and is confident that it could ‘comfortable handle’ and overnight switch to EVs, which would push up demand by only 10%.\nEV Practicality Myths\nPracticality myths\nEVs Are Harder to Drive\nFalse.\nAs with all new things, learning to drive an EV will take time – but it doesn’t have to be hard. EVs don’t have an ignition, instead operating with a touch screen in the centre console of the car. However, if you can use a smartphone, an EV won’t be a challenge.\nEVs Can’t Drive Through Water\nFalse.\nIt has been suggested that due to the electrical component EVs would not be able to navigate water, whether that be a flooded road or large puddle. However, EVs are in fact more equipped in these situations than petrol or diesel vehicles as they do not inhale water.\nEVs Catch Fire\nFalse.\nIn 2022, The Fire Service reported 18,991 road vehicle fires in the UK, only 239 of these fires were caused by battery powered vehicles, which includes the like of e-scooters, e-bikes and electric forklifts. This means only 1.25% of all vehicle fires were caused by electric vehicles of any kind during the entire year.\nEV Cost Myths\nCost myths\nEVs Are too Expensive\nFalse.\nEV prices already have and continue to fall, closing the gap between EVs and petrol- or diesel-powered vehicles.\nEVs Cost too Much to Maintain\nFalse.\nMaintenance costs are a worry for any driver – however, choosing an EV will not break the bank. EV service can cost up to 30% less than a petrol vehicle and 60% less than a diesel vehicle. This is due to the lack of moving parts featured in an EV engine meaning there are no spark plugs, oil, belts, chains, exhausts or clutches to service or repair.",
