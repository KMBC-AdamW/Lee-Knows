Jacob completed his journey to join us, and we're excited to have him on board.\nA Message from Citrus\nAt Citrus, the success of our apprentices is a team effort. If you have the opportunity to work with an apprentice, make it count! Offer them diverse experiences and guidance. Our apprentices have the potential to become some of our best employees, with support from Citrus colleagues like you.\nLivv Housing\nClaudia's Story\nClaudia is our Customer Insight Apprentice at Livv Housing. She shares, \"Before my apprenticeship, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. At Livv, I've explored different areas within my department, giving me a clearer direction.\"\nClaudia joined in September 2021 and has been thriving at Livv. She learns something new every day and values the supportive and welcoming atmosphere.\nNiall's Story\nNiall Walsh serves as an Assistant Property Manager at Livv Housing. He joined as an Apprentice Site Manager in 2018 at the age of 19, following his preference for hands-on work.\nAfter 18 months, he earned the role of Assistant Property Manager, a testament to the growth he achieved through his apprenticeship journey.\nSteven's Story\nSteven, a Finance Advisor – Property at Livv Housing, reflects on his apprenticeship journey. \"My apprenticeship not only developed my job skills but also enhanced crucial life skills like communication, time management, and teamwork. My overall confidence has grown too.\"\nHe believes apprenticeships are vital for young people, allowing them to transfer skills to their roles and daily life.\nPaul's Story\nPaul is our Electrical Apprentice at Livv Housing. He shares, \"I'm thoroughly enjoying my apprenticeship, especially learning the fundamentals of becoming an Electrician. Every day brings something new.\"\nAlongside the monthly support he receives from Knowsley Apprentice, Paul appreciates the welcoming team at Livv, who've made him feel like part of the family.\nMandy Manning, Learning & Development Manager\nMandy Manning, Learning & Development Manager at Livv Housing Group, emphasises their partnership with The Knowsley Apprentice, which has been key resource for nearly 15 years.\nLivv's apprenticeships give local young people with the opportunity to learn while earning, developing essential skills, knowledge, and confidence. These apprenticeships have paved the way for over 170 young people to kickstart their careers.\nMandy is proud of the success rate of their apprenticeships, with many employees advancing from apprentices to leadership roles. She believes that Knowsley Apprentice's partnership is crucial in offering local youth alternative paths to education and work, eliminating the need to travel outside the borough for opportunities.\nSteven A Hunt and Associates\n\"Last year, we had the privilege of participating in the Knowsley Apprenticeship scheme to hire a Junior Design Engineer. Thanks to this programme, we welcomed Thomas, who is now in his first year at LJMU, pursuing a Building Services Design Engineer Degree Apprenticeship.\"\n\"We greatly appreciate the support from Mandy, KMBC Young Persons Mentor. She not only promoted our vacancy in the Knowsley area but also among the young people she was assisting. This, along with an advert on the National Apprenticeship website, helped us find the right candidate.\"\n\"Knowing that the candidates referred by Mandy possessed the necessary attributes and qualifications for consideration was valuable. Equally important was the advice and guidance they received on essential employability skills.\"\n\"In addition to national government funding, the Knowsley financial incentive package proved extremely useful, especially for a smaller employer like us. It aided in covering training and mentoring expenses once Thomas joined our team.\"\n\"We appreciate that Mandy continues to monitor Thomas's progress, providing an external perspective that can help him feel comfortable in sharing any concerns.\"\nSt Albert's Catholic Primary School\nLisa Jewell, the School's Business Manager, shares, \"We decided to hire an apprentice for our school office, offering a young person the chance to secure a full-time job where they can learn and earn while bringing fresh ideas to our workplace.\"\n\"The Knowsley Apprentice Team has been helpful throughout the advertising and interviewing process, providing ongoing support for both us and our apprentice.\"",
