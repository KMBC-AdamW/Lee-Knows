But if one of you fails to pay, the other person is liable to pay the full amount.\nMarried and unmarried couples\nHusbands and wives and unmarried couples living together are liable to pay Council Tax even if only one of them owns or rents the property.  The bill will show all the names, although only one bill may be sent.\nEmpty homes discount\nFor unoccupied and unfurnished properties, a discount of 100% is available for one calendar month from the date that the property first became unoccupied and unfurnished. After this date, the full Council Tax charge becomes due.\nIf you buy or rent a property that is already empty and unfurnished, then the previous owner or landlord may have already been granted the discount, so you may not be eligible for the 1 month discount.\nProperties that require major repairs will be charged at the full Council Tax level from the date they become vacant.\nProperties which have been unoccupied and unfurnished in excess of two years will be subject to an additional premium charge of 100%. Properties which have been unoccupied and unfurnished for more than 5 years will be subject to a premium charge of 200%. Properties which have been unoccupied and unfurnished for more than 10 years will be subject to a premium charge of 300%.\nYou must notify us within 21 days if you believe that the premium charge does not apply.\nSecond home reductions\nCertain second homes are eligible for a 50% reduction on their Council Tax bill.\nThe council tax payer lives elsewhere in job-related accommodation specified by the terms and conditions of their contract, for example: caretakers, ministers of religion or members of the armed forces.  This does not apply to second homes that are rented because they are convenient for work.\nHomes that are pitches or moorings occupied by caravans or boats\nA planning restriction means you’re unable to occupy the property for at least 28 continuous days a year\nPlease contact us via online chat if you think you may qualify for any of these discounts.\nWhen the owner should pay the Council Tax\nThe owner, rather than the occupier, is liable to pay the Council Tax in the following special cases:\nHouses in multiple occupation, e.g. groups of bedsits which share washing and cooking facilities.\nCare and nursing homes together with some hostels.\nProperties occupied only be religious communities.\nSome second homes.\nSome vicarages.\nProperties occupied by asylum seekers.\nDepending on your circumstances and those who live with you, you may be entitled to a\nCouncil Tax discount or exemption\n.",

We may do this if you have not made or kept to an agreed repayment plan or have not completed and returned the request for financial information form.\nBefore we ask the Enforcement Agent to visit you, we will have sent you details once the court have issued a Liability Order of the fees, which may be charged to you if an enforcement agent is instructed.\nIf your debt has been passed to an Enforcement Agent, you will incur a fixed fee of £75 upon them issuing a letter to you by post.  Any payments or offers of repayment should be made to the Enforcement Agents and not the Council.\nIf the Enforcement Agent visits you, there is a fixed fee of £235 plus 7.5% for any balance due above £1,500.\nThe Enforcement Agent will normally ask you for payment in full; however, if you cannot meet this request, the Enforcement Agent will normally make a repayment arrangement with you. The Enforcement Agent may enter into a Controlled Goods Agreement, where the agent lists your possessions equal in value to your debt.\nIf your possessions are subject to a Controlled Goods Agreement, you cannot dispose or sell them without the Enforcement Agent's permission.\nIf you do not pay as agreed and have signed a Controlled Goods Agreement, the Enforcement Agent may enter your property by force if necessary, to take the goods listed. You will be charged for the removal and sale of them. The fee for this is £110 plus 7.5% for any balance due above £1,500.\nIf the Enforcement Agent believes that there are insufficient items to clear the debt, we will then consider other recovery options such as committal action, bankruptcy, imprisonment or a charging order against your property.",
