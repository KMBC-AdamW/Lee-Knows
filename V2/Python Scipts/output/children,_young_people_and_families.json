    "text": "Overview\nThere are many types of childcare: early education or preschool services, childminders, nurseries, nursery classes or out-of-school clubs.\nHere are some key questions to ask a childcare provider:\nHow long have you been working with children, and what qualifications do you have?\nCan I look around the building to see the rooms and outside play space?\nDo the children have access to the outdoors?\nAre there suitable sleeping arrangements?\nDo you provide my child/children with healthy food and drinks?\nWhat will my child do all day?\nWhat kind of activities do you plan?\nWill you keep a daily record of what they have done?\nHow do you encourage good behaviour?\nWill my child be with a regular group of children? How old are they? How will their timetable fit in with my child?\nHow can I make sure my child is settling in well?\nCan I see how the security and signing-in books work?\nOther things to look out for:\nAre the children calm, safe and happy?\nDo children play and talk together, and are they calm, safe and happy?\nAre the staff friendly, listening to children and answering them carefully?\nAre there lots of fun activities planned to help children learn and play, and do staff join in?\nAre there plenty of clean toys and equipment for children to use?\nDo parents have plenty of chances to say what they want for their children?\nYou should ask for their Ofsted Registration certificate and the most recent Ofsted Inspection report. Their registration ensures that they meet the 14 National Standards, that all staff have DBS checks and all staff have undertaken relevant training.\nBenefits for your child\nHigh-quality childcare and early education gives your child a head start in primary school; research shows that it improves their educational, emotional and social development.\nThe benefits of part-time attendance are just as good as those for full-time.",

This may include Children identified as needing support or at risk of suffering abuse.\nKnowsley MASH operates between 9.00 am to 5.00 pm Monday to Friday and can be contacted via\nemail\nor by dialling 0151 443 2600.\nMembers of the public should always make contact by telephone.\nIf you contact MASH by telephone, you will be asked a series of questions when making a referral to ensure as much information as possible can be gained to support what level of need is identified and what action is required by whom.\nProfessionals who work with children and who need to raise a concern should use the\nMulti-agency Referral Form (MARF)\n. The form should be emailed to the MASH team when it is completed. If there is any sense of urgency regarding the concern being raised, the form should be sent, followed by a phone call to MASH to highlight the urgency of the case. If you need help in respect of filling in the form, you can also give the MASH a call for advice.\nThere is no pre-requisite to complete an Early Help Assessment (EHA) before referring to Children’s Social Care. However, if the concerns do not require social work interventions, it will be expected that support is provided to the family via an Early Help Assessment. If an EHA has been completed at the point of referral, this should be sent with the\nMARF\nor sent separately if the referral is received via a telephone call.\nAt all other times, the Emergency Duty Team (EDT) is the ‘first point of contact’ for Children’s Social Care.\nEDT can be contacted using the same number as the MASH – 0151 443 2600.\nEDT will only respond to Emergencies that cannot wait until the next working day. This is usually circumstances where there are immediate concerns regarding the welfare or safety of children, or there is a risk of family breakdown and the child being placed in care.\nPlease note if you believe a child or young person is at immediate risk of harm, you should contact the police urgently.",

    "text": "Private fostering is when a child under 16 (or under 18 if disabled) lives with someone who is not a close relative for 28 days or more. This might be a friend, a great aunt, a cousin or someone else known to the child. A close relative is defined as a grandparent, aunt, uncle, brother or step-parent by marriage. Many parents who have arranged for someone else to care for their child don’t realise that they have entered into a private fostering arrangement when they have made informal arrangements with friends or extended family.\nTo keep vulnerable children safe and support families, by law, parents and carers must notify their local authority if they have a private fostering arrangement in place. There are many reasons why children are privately fostered. Such examples include:\nparental ill health children or young people from overseas who visit this country for education or health care reasons\nchildren or young people who are living with a friend/boyfriend/girlfriend’s family as a result of parental separation, divorce or arguments at home\nchildren or young people whose parents work or study long or anti-social hours\nchildren or teenagers on school holiday exchanges that last more than 28 days\nchildren or teenagers on sports or music sponsorships live away from their families. A parent or an agency, such as a college or sports academy, would normally make such an arrangement\nEven though this is a private arrangement, the law says that the local authority must ensure your child is safe and well cared for.\nIf you are thinking of placing your child in a private fostering arrangement, you must tell the local authority at least six weeks beforehand or, in case of an emergency placement, within 48 hours of the placement beginning.\nIf the arrangement has already started, you must contact Knowsley Borough Council immediately on 0151 443 2929.\nSee leaflets for more information:\nDocument\nPrivate Fostering - A Guide for parents and carers_.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n356.58KB\n)\nDocument\nPrivate Fostering - Children YP.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n215.73KB\n)",

In Kirkby, the house is an edge-of-care short breaks service which offers weekend breaks and weekday bridging support for families.\nAll of the homes are subject to Ofsted inspections and in 2023, were all graded as ‘Good’.\nAccessing the service\nWe provide this service for children and young people who have been assessed as needing residential accommodation following a social worker's assessment. The assessment is conducted with the young person, their family or carers and social worker.\nMore information\nDocument\nKnowsley Sufficiency Position Statement 2022-2025.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n554.41KB\n)\nFor further information about this service, contact your assigned social worker or Children Services on 0151 443 2600.",

CSC has received two awards from IIC and will continue to conduct external assessments annually to keep participation high on the agenda.  This has supported us to focus more on a ‘you said, we did’ approach where we listen to our children, take on board their experiences, and react in response to their thoughts, wishes and feelings.\nHere are some examples of how we have responded to what children have said:\nThe Corporate Parenting Board works closely with Children’s Social Care to ensure targets set out in the Corporate Parenting Plan are met. It engages feedback from MADE Together to help improve the delivery of services and monitors a ‘you said, we did’ action plan linked to what children have asked decision-makers to consider.\nMADE Together is a new shadow board to the Corporate Parenting Board which brings together decision-makers, MADE and the care experienced people forum to hold council services to account.  This will help improve the care experiences of all cared-for children and the support offered for care-experienced people.\nMADE Together meets bi-annually with regular Keep in Touch (KIT) meetings with directors, heads of service and commissioned services to progress their agenda. (March and September)\nThe Corporate Parenting Board support the MADE agenda to reach other decision makers and related partners to progress their agenda, such as links with the health and wellbeing board and the Knowsley safeguarding children’s partnership.\nCommissioned service and voluntary and community service across Knowsley and beyond, link with the participation officer, MADE, young advisors from Knowsley Safeguarding Children Partnership (KSCP) and care experienced people to build on offers of support, including the\nLocal Offer for Care Experienced People\n, mental health support services and projects, creative arts projects, access to leisure and support for young parents.",

    "text": "Young carers are children and young people who look after someone in their family who has an illness, a disability, or is affected by mental ill-health or substance misuse. Young Carers often take on practical and/or emotional caring responsibilities that would normally be expected of an adult.\nIn partnership with Vibe, we take a whole family approach to assessing and supporting carers, providing support wherever possible. This may include a trip or activity for peer support or a one-to-one chat with trained workers.  We support families to ensure that they receive a full package of help that they require, making sure all the relevant services are involved.  This helps to ensure that young carers do not need to take on inappropriate levels of care that could be detrimental to their own health and well-being.\nThe young carer assessment is child-friendly and easily accessible and incorporates many elements of All About Me. Assessments often provide considerable insight into not only the wishes and feelings of children but also their perceptions, which can improve and inform current support plans.\nThe service also works alongside schools in Knowsley to promote and identify Young Carers. This involves raising awareness through assemblies, training with teaching staff and through the promotion of the Young Carers Schools Award.\nCriteria\nAll answers must be YES to meet the criteria for the young person:\nYoung person aged between 6-18 years old\nLives in Knowsley Borough\nIs aware of the referral, and parent/guardian consent has been given\nCares for a family member (parent/sibling/other relative)\nContact\nEmail:\nKnowsley.YoungCarers@knowsley.gov.uk\n‘Me Time’ programme - Help for young carers\nKnowsley Young Carers can access the 'Me Time' programme, which is a session for local young carers to take a break from caring for family members. The session runs Mondays and Wednesdays from various sites in Knowsley, providing opportunities for young carers to get involved in new and exciting activities such as Camp craft, orienteering, water sports and other outdoor education activities, Cultural trips such as visiting theatres and cinema or taking part in more mainstream sports such as football, netball etc. Or you can just come and chill with your friends and the youth workers and maybe try some generic youth activities.\nTo get involved, please contact Steven Blackhurst\nPhone: 07585 987 447\nEmail:\nsteven.blackhurst@vibeuk.org\nAlternatively – contact Sharon McGinnity\nPhone: 07775 221 879\nEmail:\nSharon.mcginnity@vibeuk.org",
