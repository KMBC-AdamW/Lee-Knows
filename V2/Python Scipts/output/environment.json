Not all roads will be suitable to close for street parties.\nRoads that will be suitable will be local roads, cul-de-sacs and residential roads. If it is not possible to close your road, the council would consider a request to hold your street party in your local park.\nPlease note we can only close a road for a street party once a year.",

    "text": "Important information\nThe council has introduced these charges because it can no longer afford to provide the service for free. The majority of other councils charge for pest control, and the rates charged by the Knowsley Council are lower than those charged by commercial companies.\nThe council is not legally bound to provide a free pest control service, and the responsibility for controlling pests lies with the owner or occupier of the premises or land where they are present.\nThe charge for pest control covers a maximum of two visits for rats and mice, as most domestic infestations can be eradicated in two visits. If an infestation is heavy and more visits are required, there will be an additional charge.\nIf you have spotted mice or rats on your property but cannot afford the charge for a pest control visit, there are a number of simple things you can do to prevent or control the infestation yourself. Traps and baits are widely available at DIY stores and garden centres.\nIf you are a tenant, your landlord may be responsible for paying for pest control treatment. This will depend on the terms of your tenancy agreement, whether the infestation pre-dated you moving in, and whether the problem has been made worse by disrepair or caused by your actions.\nIf you have made a pest control appointment and need to cancel, you will receive a full refund if you give at least 24 hours' notice. There will be no refund for cancellations made on the day of the visit or if you are not at home when the operative calls.\nThe council is working with social landlords to improve tenancy management and minimise the risk of infestation.",

    "text": "Before you apply\nYou must read and agree to our\nTerms and Conditions\n.\nBefore applying to close a road for a street party, you should consider the following:\nInsurance & Indemnity\nThe Borough of Knowsley will not be held responsible for any damage to property or injury to any person arising from or in connection with the street party or other event.\nIt is your responsibility to consider whether to arrange an appropriate policy of insurance that will protect and indemnify you against any claim or cost arising from such an incident; that decision remains solely yours.\nFurther advice on obtaining such insurance can be found\nhere\n.\nRisk assessments\nWe do not require you to provide us with a formal risk assessment but you should think about what could go wrong and have a backup plan. We recommend you read the advice that can be found at\nwww.thebiglunch.com\nand\nwww.streetparty.org.uk\n.\nAlcohol licence\nLicences are only required if alcohol is sold. At a private party, sharing drinks with your neighbours does not require a licence.\nIf you do want to sell alcohol, you will need to contact the Council’s licensing team for a Temporary Events Notice form. This form costs £21, and you should apply at least ten working days before your event. For more information, contact the licensing team on 0151 443 2300 or\nsend them an email\n.\nMusic or entertainment licence\nIf your street party is a private party for residents and the music is not advertised in advance to attract people, and you’re not making money, then there is no need for a licence for your music, whether it’s live or recorded.\nFood permits\nAs a private party, you do not need a licence under the Licensing Act 2003 to sell food (unless you want to only sell hot food and drink after 11pm). Remember you can always ask your neighbours to bake a cake, make a sandwich or bring food to share. This is also a good way to bring different groups of people together.\nTombolas and raffles\nIf the tombola/raffle tickets are sold on the day, and the prizes are not worth more than £500, they will be exempt from gambling regulations; however, if tickets are sold before the event, you will need a lottery registration. Please speak to Knowsley's licensing team on 0151 443 2300.\nAny proceeds from the tombola/raffle must go to a good cause, such as charity or even covering the cost of your party. Alternatively, if you want to raise money for your local church or charity, you can always ask people for donations.\nNoise\nPlease be considerate of neighbours who may not be participating in your event – remember there may also be shift workers or children trying to sleep even in the daytime. If you have to talk louder against any music, then it’s probably too loud for neighbours.\nNoise travels further at night, and if it is warm, windows and doors may be open.  Please bear this in mind when planning what type of activities you may organise for the evening.\nThe council recommends that street parties finish no later than 9pm.\nTraffic Management\nThe council does not have road signs that you can borrow and recommends hiring appropriate signs and barriers from a local hire centre. Signs must be waterproof if the weather is wet and reflective if your street party lasts until dusk/nightfall.\nAccess\nYou must also be aware of the needs of others, such as visiting doctors and nurses and other home visiting services and make suitable arrangements.\nCleaning up\nYou will need to clean up after your street party. It’s your street, your party, so keep your local area clean and tidy. Let people know in advance what time the party will finish and have a section set aside for bin bags and recycling.",

Wasp stings are not normally serious, but the elderly and those with allergies can suffer severe reactions. Unless the location of the nest is causing a problem treatment should be avoided.\nSigns to look for around your home\nWasps can be confused with other winged insects. Wasps have yellow and jet black stripes on their bodies and two pairs of wings. Queen wasps sleep in safe locations like wood piles and roof spaces during the winter months. They emerge from April onwards and seek suitable places to build new nests. Wasps build new nests each year and never return to an old nest, so it is not necessary to remove old or treated nests. Lack of activity around the nest will indicate if it is no longer active.\nNests are grey and ball-shaped and can be quite large. Other signs of a nest include:\nWasps entering and exiting buildings from one location\nWet patches on walls or ceilings\nA dull, buzzing noise\nHow to prevent wasps\n• Keep bagged refuse and lidded bins with potential food sources away from your house\n• Inspect your loft throughout the summer months to check for nests\nTreating and controlling wasps\nSelf treatment of nests that are above head height is not recommended. It may be possible to treat nests that are more easily accessible.\nBefore any self treatment we recommend that you\nRefer to the insecticide instructions before use\nIdentify the entrance and exit point of the nest\nConduct treatments at twilight when there will be less activity and most of the wasps will be in the nest\nBlow or spray the insecticide into the entry point of the nest\nMake sure other residents are aware of the treatment and that they avoid the nest area for 24 hours\nWash away any spillages of insecticide when safe to do so\nWasp stings can be dangerous and can cause severe reactions so ensure that you wear protective clothing during self treatment.",

Garden ants swarm as they fly away to find a site to create a new colony each year.

    "text": "The Food Hygiene Rating Scheme is a national program operated by Knowsley Council to help consumers make informed decisions about where to eat out or shop for food. The scheme also encourages businesses to maintain high hygiene standards.\nHow the scheme works\nFood hygiene ratings are based on inspections conducted by Environmental Health Officers. The ratings are based on three factors:\nFood safety practices and procedures\nStructure and cleaning\nConfidence in management\nBusinesses included in the scheme\nOnly businesses that directly supply the public with food are included in the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme. Examples of such businesses include most food shops, cafes, restaurants, takeaways, and pubs.\nRating system\nFood hygiene ratings range from 5 (Very good) to 0 (Urgent improvement required). Scores are published on the national Food Hygiene Website. Businesses are also provided with a sticker outlining their rating.\nDisplaying ratings\nWhile it is not currently a legal requirement to display a food hygiene rating sticker in England, businesses are encouraged to do so. If a food business does display a rating sticker, it must display the most recent hygiene rating.\nRight to appeal\nBusinesses have the right to appeal against a food hygiene rating if they disagree with it.\nThey are encouraged to first discuss the rating informally with the inspecting officer.\nIf the business is still unsatisfied, they can lodge a formal appeal within 21 days of being informed of the rating.\nRight to reply\nBusiness owners or managers also have a \"right to reply.\"\nThis means they can submit an explanation of how the business has improved hygiene or to describe any unusual circumstances at the time of the inspection.\nThe business's right to reply will be published online by the Council alongside the business's hygiene rating.\nRequest for reinspection\nBusinesses can request a reinspection if they have made significant improvements to their hygiene standards. There is a charge for this service.\nPlease note that if standards have deteriorated, the rating can go down.\nAdditional information\nFor more information about the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme, please visit the\nFood Standards Agency website\n.\nDocuments\nAppeal form\nDocument\nFood-Hygiene-Appeal-Form (1).doc\n(\nDOC\n,\n170KB\n)\nRight to reply form\nDocument\nFood-Hygiene-Right-of-Reply-(1).doc\n(\nDOC\n,\n176KB\n)\nReturn to\nEnvironmental Health Service\nKnowsley Council\n2nd Floor\nMunicipal Building\nArchway Road\nHuyton\nKnowsley\nL36 9YU",

    "text": "Japanese knotweed, also known as Fallopia japonica, is an invasive plant that spreads rapidly and crowds out other native vegetation. It can grow almost anywhere, including gardens, parks, and roadsides.\nThis aggressive plant can cause significant damage, including\nLoss of native plant species\nStructural damage\nLand value reduction\nMortgage difficulties\nRecognising Japanese knotweed\nHere are key features to help identify Japanese knotweed:\nLarge, green, shovel-shaped leaves\nJapanese knotweed leaves are distinctively large and shaped like shovels. They are typically 10-15 centimetres long and have a smooth, glossy surface.\nVertical bamboo-like stems\nThe plant's stems are hollow and can grow up to 3 meters tall. They are typically green but may turn red or purple in autumn.\nWhite flowers\nJapanese knotweed produces white flowers in late summer or early autumn. The flowers form small clusters along the stems.\nControlling Japanese knotweed\nControlling Japanese knotweed can be challenging as it is an invasive species of plant which spreads rapidly and overwhelms other plants. It is crucial to prevent the plant from spreading to other areas.\nLandowner responsibility\nThe landowner is responsible for controlling Japanese knotweed on their property. This includes preventing the plant from spreading to neighbouring lands or public spaces.\nConsult landowners\nIf you find Japanese knotweed on private land, such as a neighbour's property or a construction site, contact the landowner first. If no action is taken, report the issue to the Environmental Health department.\nPublic or council-owned land\nFor Japanese knotweed on public or council-owned land, contact the Environmental Sustainability Service.\nProper disposal\nDo not remove or dispose of Japanese knotweed on your own, putting it in your bin or local waste centre is an offence. Contact a specialist contractor for proper removal and disposal.\nIntentionally spreading Japanese knotweed is an offence. Improper disposal of the plant can also lead to legal consequences.\nMore information\nFor more information on Japanese knotweed, including identification, control methods, and legal obligations, visit\nGov.uk.\nContact\nEnvironmental Health\nAddress\n2nd Floor\nMunicipal Building\nArchway Road\nHuyton\nL36 9FB\nTelephone\n0151 443 4712\nEmail\nenvironmentalhealth@knowsley.gov.uk\nThe Environmental Sustainability Service\nEmail\ness.enquiries@knowsley.gov.uk",

They may visit your property to witness the noise or install noise monitoring equipment.

This will help the council to understand the nature of the noise and how it is affecting you.\nWe will only contact you and investigate the noise further if you have completed and returned the noise log sheets.\nThe noise log sheets are needed to show that the noise is a potential statutory nuisance.\nIf the noise log sheets do not provide enough evidence of a statutory nuisance, we will close the case and let you know how you can take private action.\nDownload a noise log\nDocument\nNuisance log sheet.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n35.38KB\n)\nOnce you have completed the noise log, return it to the council within 21 days.\nReturn to\nAddress\nEnvironmental Health\n2nd Floor\nMunicipal Building\nArchway Road\nHuyton\nL36 9FB\nTelephone\n0151 443 4712\nEmail\nenvironmentalhealth@knowsley.gov.uk\nOnce you have completed a noise log\nPlease then report a noise complaint using the button below.

    "text": "The most common types of statutory nuisances\nNoise\nThis can include noise from neighbours, businesses, or other sources. Factors that are considered when determining if a noise is a statutory nuisance include the frequency and duration of the noise, the context (such as the location, other noise sources nearby, and the time of day), the volume, and any tonal elements of the noise.\nTo find out more about how to log a noise complaint please visit out\nNoise complaints page.\nSmoke and fumes\nIt is illegal to burn certain materials, such as household waste, rubber, painted or treated wood, furniture, tires, and plastic.\nLight\nLight nuisance is caused by artificial light emitted from premises. To be a nuisance, the light must be disturbing to your life, occur frequently, occur at a time of day when it is not expected, and be caused by malicious or ordinary behaviour.\nUnpleasant odours\nWe deal with complaints of smells which cause a nuisance in your home as a result of trade, industrial or agricultural activities.\nOvergrown/rubbish in garden\nIf your neighbour lets rubbish build up on their land, or allows their garden to become overgrown, it could cause problems that affect you.\nPlease note that we cannot take action against smells from a domestic property unless it is due to a build-up of waste at that property. Smells from land or muck spreading are usually temporary and pose little risk to health. We would not investigate a complaint about land spreading unless it became a frequent occurrence.\nWhat you can do\nBefore you contact Environmental Health, we would advise you to discuss the problem with your neighbour. Often, they simply do not realise they are causing a problem.\nIn most instances, light pollution being the exception, we will request that you complete a nuisance log sheet.\nGuidance on how to complete the sheets and for how long can be found on the log sheet. You must then return the log sheet to Environmental Health.\nDownload a log sheet here\nDocument\nnuisance-log-sheet-(3).docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n35.96KB\n)\nTo report a statutory nuisance please use the contact information below.\nContact\nEnvironmental Health\nAddress\n2nd Floor\nMunicipal Building\nArchway Road\nHuyton\nL36 9FB\nTelephone\n0151 443 4712\nEmail\nenvironmentalhealth@knowsley.gov.uk",

They may be able to solve the problem without the need for further action.\nYour rights\nThe law does not allow you to take action against a neighbour for having an unkempt or slightly overgrown garden. However, you may be able to take action if the garden is causing a statutory nuisance, such as by attracting pests or causing a smell.\nTaking action yourself\nYou cannot trespass onto your neighbour's land to remove any rubbish or foliage yourself.\nIf a neighbour's hedge, brambles, or tree are causing problems on your side of the boundary, you are entitled to prune or remove anything that comes over onto your side of the boundary. However, you must offer any clippings back to your neighbour.\nFor further information,\nvisit our Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) and development work page.\nReporting an overgrown garden or land\nIf you are still being affected by a build-up of waste on your neighbour's land or garden, you can report it to Environmental Health. Environmental Health will investigate to see if the waste, rubbish, and vegetation is causing a statutory nuisance.\nIf it is, they can talk to the owner or occupier of the property and explain what action they need to take. If the problem does not improve, Environmental Health can serve a legal notice on the person responsible.\nWhat Environmental Health cannot do\nEnvironmental Health cannot take any action for untidy gardens, or for any \"inert matter\".

    "text": "Dog fouling is a crime\nIt is illegal to let your dog foul in a public place without cleaning it up. This is known as dog fouling and it is an act of environmental anti-social behaviour.\nThe consequences of dog fouling\nDog fouling is unpleasant and can cause serious illness, such as blindness, to people through an infection called Toxocariasis. This infection is caused by worms found in dogs' intestines.\nEnforcement officers patrol the Borough and issue Fixed Penalty Notices to people who fail to clean up after their dogs. If you are caught not cleaning up after your dog, you could be issued with a £100 Fixed Penalty Notice. If you do not pay the Fixed Penalty Notice, you could be prosecuted in a magistrate's court.\nWhat you can do\nIf you are a dog owner or walker, please always carry a bag when you walk your dog. Bag up your dog waste securely (ideally double bag it) and dispose of it in any public litter bin. You can report a damaged or overflowing bin online.\nIf you have a garden, train your dog to do its mess there and make sure you clean it up and put it in your red waste bin straight away. Never put animal mess in your blue or grey waste bins.\nNever let your dog go outside to do its mess alone.\nMore information\nIf you are in charge of a dog at the time it fouls, you are responsible for cleaning up after it. Even if you don't know your dog has fouled, or don't have a poop scoop, it is no excuse. You should always make sure to bring along the means to clean up after your dog when you take it outside.\nOnce you have cleaned up the dog waste, you can put it in any ordinary litter bin, as long as it is securely wrapped. If there is no bin available, take the waste home and dispose of it in your red waste bin.\nBy cleaning up after your dog, you are acting as a responsible owner and protecting children's health and the environment.\nHow to report dog fouling\nIf you see someone letting their dog foul without cleaning it up, or you know of an area that needs to be patrolled, please report it to us. You can do this by clicking on the link at the bottom of this page.\nIf you can provide information about the person responsible, such as their name and address, we may contact you to obtain further evidence as part of our investigation.\nReport here",

    "text": "Knowsley has two award-winning multi-faith cemeteries\nKnowsley Cemetery, Fox's Bank Lane\nThis 8.9-acre cemetery is in the southeast of Knowsley and has excellent road, rail, and public transport links. It is bordered by farms and woodland to the south and east. The cemetery features a number of decorative gardens, including the Hope and Heart Gardens. Burial plots and areas for the burial of cremated remains are available.\nPrescot Cemetery, Manchester Road\nThis cemetery is within walking distance of Prescot town centre. It is closed for the purchase of new burial plots, with internments taking place in private and family plots only.\nClosed churchyards\nThere are also two closed churchyards in Knowsley:\nSt Chad's, Kirkby\nThis churchyard dates back 140 years.\nSt Michael's, Huyton\nThis churchyard is one of the smallest cemeteries maintained by Knowsley Council. It was closed in 2001.\nBurial and cremation\nPurchasing a grave\nYou can buy grave space burial rights for a period of 99 years at the Cemetery Office. You can also buy a grave in advance to be reserved for future use. For further advice, please contact the Cemeteries Office or your funeral director. New graves are available at Fox's Bank Lane Cemetery.\nSelecting a grave plot\nThe Council offers two types of traditional grave plots, lawn burial graves and cremation-only graves. A range of alternative graves and memorials is also available. Cemetery staff at both Knowsley Cemetery and the Cemeteries Office can advise you of these options.\nBurial plots\nBurial plots at Fox's Bank Lane Cemetery have been designed to accommodate a maximum of three coffins and four cremated remains caskets.\nCremated remains graves\nA special area has been designed for the burial of ashes at Fox's Bank Lane Cemetery. Each plot is allocated with a 99-year right of burial and will accept up to six sets of ashes. Memorial headstones can be placed on the grave.\nScattering of ashes\nArrangements can be made to scatter ashes in the Garden of Remembrance at Fox's Bank Lane Cemetery according to the wishes of families.\nAbove and below ground vaults\nAt Knowsley Cemetery, there are graves that allow for the interment of cremated remains. These are the Barns Plaque below ground vaults and the Columbarium Above ground vaults, both allowing up to two cremations.\nMemorials\nThere are several memorial options in the Garden of Remembrance. Memorials can be leased for 10-year periods, with the option to renew. There is no further charge for maintenance or upkeep during that period of dedication.\nMemorial safety\nTo ensure the safety of visitors and staff, Knowsley Council carries out a safety audit of all memorials. The Council will make safe any memorial found to be in immediate danger and will then attempt to contact the owner. Memorials remain the property and responsibility of registered grave owners, who are required to ensure their memorial is safe. Should owners find their memorials are unsafe, repairs should be carried out by a monumental mason.\nOpening times\nCemeteries and car parks are always open to the public. However, the main gates at Knowsley Cemetery will only be open for funeral vehicle or disability access.\nSearching of Burial and Cremation Registers\nAll records are held at the Cemeteries Office, Council Offices, Stretton Way, Huyton. The office is open Monday to Friday from 9am to 4pm.\nContact\nAddress\nKnowsley Bereavement Services Office\nKnowsley Council Register Office\nHigh Street Prescot\nL34 3LH\nE-mail\nknowsley.bereavement.services@knowsley.gov.uk\nTelephone\n0151 443 5231",

These sweepers remove litter, debris, and leaves. We use large sweepers for major roads and smaller sweepers for smaller roads, cul-de-sacs, shopfronts, and town centers.\nWe mechanically clean approximately 1,366 kilometers of highway every four weeks.

We then return to scrape out and remove the dead vegetation.\nWinter hedge and shrubbery maintenance\nWe maintain council-owned hedges and shrubs once a year during the winter, from November to February. This includes scheduled maintenance of ornamental and field hedges, cutting back shrubbery, and extensive litter clearance in hard-to-reach areas. We avoid the bird nesting season, from February to August, in line with the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.\nPrivately owned land\nWe do not maintain privately owned land unless we have a service level agreement with the landowner.

    "text": "Problems caused by empty homes\nEmpty homes can be a real eyesore and can make an area look neglected. They can also attract crime and anti-social behaviour, and can even be a safety hazard. In addition, empty homes can devalue surrounding properties and can stop people who are homeless or vulnerable from getting a home.\nWhat can be done about empty homes\nIf you are an empty home owner, there are a number of things you can do to bring your property back into use. You could:\nOccupy the property yourself or move in a relative or friend.\nRent or lease your property.\nSell your property on to an owner-occupier, developer, or housing association.\nHelp available to empty home owners\nIf you own an empty property that you are struggling to bring back into use, there is help available. The council can provide you with:\nGuidance on how to sell your property.\nGuidance on how to rent out your property.\nFinancial assistance.\nHelp to maximise property opportunities, such as conversions.\nAdvice on how to find a suitable builder.\nThe benefits of bringing empty homes back into use\nThere are many benefits to bringing empty homes back into use. These include:\nAdded security against anti-social behaviour, crime, and squatting.\nThe ability to charge rent if you become a landlord.\nLong-term investment potential.\nThe property is no longer a local eyesore.\nImproved local area, making it more attractive to investors.\nA safer area to live in.\nWhen the council take enforcement action\nThe council will try as much as possible to work with owners to bring empty properties back into use. However, if an owner is unwilling to cooperate and their empty home is causing problems in the neighbourhood, the council may have to consider legal action.\nOptions available to the council include:\nStatutory enforcement action\nThe council can use a wide range of enforcement powers to make sure an owner improves their property.\nEmpty Dwelling Management Order (EDMO)\nThis enables the council or a nominated party (usually a registered provider) to take over management of the property for up to seven years.\nEnforced sale\nThis allows the council to force the sale of an empty property to recover debts owed to the council.\nCompulsory Purchase Order (CPO)\nThis allows the council to buy a property from an owner even if they don't give their consent.\nMatching empty homes\nThe council also runs a\nMatchmaker Scheme\nthat matches empty properties with potential buyers. This can be a great way to sell your empty property quickly and easily.\nFor further information, you can read our Empty Homes Strategy below.\nDocument\nEmpty-Homes-Strategy-2016-2021_1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n2.51MB\n)\nCouncil Tax on an empty home\nEmpty properties may be entitled to a\nCouncil Tax discount\nunder certain circumstances.\nEmpty homes in your area\nIf you are concerned about an empty property in your neighbourhood, you can\nreport it here\n.\nContact\nTelephone\n0151 443 4712\nEmail\nempty.homes@knowsley.gov.uk",

You can find the\nlist of authorised fuels here\n. If you are using a DEFRA-approved appliance, please consult the specification documents for the correct fuel for those appliances.\nExempt appliances that can burn unauthorised fuels\nSome fuels that are not on DEFRA’s authorised fuels list, such as dried wood logs, can be used in an exempt appliance; however, you can still only burn the type of fuel specified in the instructions for the appliance.\nDetails of exempt appliances can be found here\n.\nYou must only use the types of fuel that the manufacturers say can be used in the appliances.\nUnder the Clean Air Act 1993, you could receive a £300 Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) if you emit smoke from your chimney in a smoke control area. Failure to pay the FPN could lead to prosecution and a fine of up to £1,000. Regardless of whether you are in a smoke control area or not, you may also be prosecuted if the smoke causes a statutory nuisance to other residents.\nWhy it matters\nAir pollution impacts the health and well-being of everyone, particularly children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions such as asthma. Harmful smoke and pollutants in the air can aggravate breathing difficulties, trigger asthma attacks, and contribute to long-term health problems like heart disease and lung cancer. By reducing smoke and other air pollutants, we can create a healthier environment for our community and protect our most vulnerable residents.\nHow can you help?\nSwitch to authorised fuels.\nAvoid open fires in smoke control areas.\nUse approved stoves and heaters.\nIf you are considering buying an appliance, please consider a DEFRA-approved appliance.\nDownloads\nDocument\nKeep it Clean Flyer.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.4MB\n)\nStill not sure if your fuel or appliance is allowed?
