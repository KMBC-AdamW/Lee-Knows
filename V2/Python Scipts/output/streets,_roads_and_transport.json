    "text": "About Blue Badges\nA Blue Badge is a pass that allows disabled people to park closer to their destination. It is a national scheme that operates in England, Scotland, and Wales. The badge is free to use and is valid for up to three years. Blue Badges are issued to the qualifying person who can then use them as a driver or a passenger in a vehicle.\nHow long your Blue Badge is valid\nA Blue Badge is issued for a maximum of 3 years. However, there are a few exceptions:\nIf you are no longer receiving qualifying benefits, such as Personal Independence Payment (PIP), Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or War Pensioners' Mobility Supplement (WPMS), your badge may expire sooner.\nFor children under 3 years old, the badge will expire on the day after their 3rd birthday. You can reapply for a new badge 3 months before your child's 3rd birthday. The process for applying for a Blue Badge is the same for children over 3 years old.",

    "text": "Keeping our highways safe\nKnowsley Council is responsible for maintaining all adopted roads and pavements across Knowsley, ensuring a safe and accessible transportation network for residents and visitors alike. The council's comprehensive highways maintenance program encompasses a wide range of tasks, from drainage and gully cleaning to pothole repairs and road marking.\nDrainage and gully cleaning\nA well maintained drainage system is crucial for preventing flooding on the road, Knowsley Council regularly inspects and cleans gullies grids, as well as drains to ensure they are free of debris and functioning effectively.\nPothole repairs\nKnowsley Council considers that a pothole is a defect in the road surface at least 40mm in depth or at least 25mm in the footway, anything less will not be repaired.Â  Knowsley Council regularly inspect the footways and roads to identify where potholes need to be repaired.\nRoad markings\nClear and visible road markings are essential for traffic safety, Knowsley Council regularly repaints road markings to ensure they can be easily seen.\nVehicle restrain barriers and pedestrian guardrails\nVehicle restraint barriers and pedestrian guardrails are used to separate pedestrians and vehicles from hazards, these are regularly inspected by Knowsley Council and repaired when necessary.\nScheduled repair works\nKnowsley Council undertakes scheduled road repairs to address larger issues and maintain the overall condition of the road network. These repairs may involve resurfacing, pavement patching, or structural improvements.\nNHT survey results\nThe National Highways andÂ Transport (NHT) Public Satisfaction Survey is a postal survey which is run annually. The survey, which covers the vast majority of Highways andÂ Transport services, asks respondents to rate their satisfaction levels with different areas of service. It uses standard questions to allow for benchmarking comparisons between all participating authorities.\nThe NHT survey includes questions on perceptions and satisfaction with highways and transport services,Â  and also collects some data on the use of different transport modes and access to services.\nDocument\nNHT Survey 2024.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n975.13KB\n)\nDocument\n2023 Authority Annual Report.PDF\n(\nPDF\n,\n969.29KB\n)\nDocument\nNHT survey report 2022.PDF\n(\nPDF\n,\n932.25KB\n)\nDocument\n2021-NHT-Survey-Executive-Summary.PDF\n(\nPDF\n,\n342.65KB\n)\nDocument\nNHT-survey-report-2020.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n751.37KB\n)\nDocument\nNHT-Survey-2019.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n319.65KB\n)\nDocument\nNHT-Survey-2018.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n994.82KB\n)\nHighway Maintenance Programme\nOur highway maintenance programme is based on an asset management approach. Asset management involves using robust data to make good, informed decisions about how we manage and maintain the highway network as effectively as possible.\nThe priorities for scheme selection are based on a number of weighting factors such as, condition data, number of safety defects, enquiries, location, usage, accident records, hierarchy and affordability.\nHighway Infrastructure and HMEP policies, plans and strategies\nYou can find out more here.",

    "text": "Gullies, also known as drains, are essential components of road drainage systems. They are large pots covered by metal grids and are typically found at the edge of roads. They also exist along kerb lines and are called kerb inlet gullies.\nWhen rainwater falls on roads, it flows into these gullies, which then direct the water to roadside ditches, sewer systems, soakaways, catchpits, and sometimes directly into watercourses.\nMost gullies are connected to public sewers, which handle both foul (sewage) and surface water. These sewers are owned and maintained by local water utility companies.\nCleaning gullies\nKnowsley Council is responsible for cleaning approximately 30,000 gullies on adopted highways. This means that the authority is responsible for maintaining gullies on public roads and pavements.\nIn contrast, gullies and surface water systems on private roads, parking areas, or non-council-maintained land are the responsibility of the landowner.\nIf you experience sewage problems, please contact the relevant water authority or landowner.\nHow often gullies are cleaned\nThe frequency of gully cleaning depends on the type of road:\nGullies on high-speed roads are cleaned twice a year (Priority 1).\nGullies on classified A, B, and C roads are cleaned once a year (Priority 2).\nGullies on unclassified roads are cleaned once every two years (Priority 3).\nIn addition to regular cleaning schedules, gullies are also cleaned when blockages are reported.\nBlocked gullies\nThe council promptly addresses blocked gullies that are reported or identified during routine inspections. The priority for gully cleaning is as follows:\nIf a blocked gully is reported and there are no reports of flooding, the gully will be cleaned within 28 days.\nIf a blocked gully is causing flooding on a highway or a neighbouring property/land, the gully will be cleared within 2-24 hours, depending on the severity of the flooding.\nIf a blocked gully is reported on a Priority 1 or Priority 2 road and there are no reports of flooding, the gully will be cleaned at the next scheduled cleaning. If the next scheduled cleaning is more than 28 days away, a new work request will be raised.\nMaintaining gullies\nIf any problems with gullies are identified during the routine maintenance of adopted highways, these will be investigated and considered as part of the annual Capital Maintenance funding.\nReasons for flooding\nWhile a well-maintained drainage system can effectively manage rainwater, there are some factors that can contribute to flooding:\nMaximum capacity\nThe highway drainage system has a maximum capacity, and if the amount of surface water exceeds this capacity, it may take longer for the water to drain away.\nFree flow of sewer systems, ditches, and watercourses\nKnowsley's highway drainage systems rely on the free flow of sewer systems, ditches, and watercourses. If any of these systems are blocked or not working properly, it can hinder the drainage of rainwater.\nHigh river levels\nWhen river levels are high, surface water may be trapped on the highway until the river levels drop.\nDamaged piped systems\nDamage to piped systems can disrupt the flow of water, leading to flooding. It is crucial to report any damage to pipes promptly.\nReport a problem\nReport a problem with highway drains\nYou can also call\n0800 0232334\n.",

If a section of the road deteriorates but is less than 40mm deep, it is not considered to be a pothole.\nFactors contributing to pothole formation\nSeveral factors contribute to the formation of potholes:\nRoad age and deterioration\nOver time, road surfaces age, becoming less flexible and more susceptible to cracking. This makes them more vulnerable to damage from water, traffic, and extreme temperatures.\nWater ingress\nWater seeping into cracks in the road surface can freeze and expand when temperatures drop. This repeated expansion and contraction process weakens the road surface, leading to potholes.\nHeavy traffic\nHeavy traffic puts excessive wear and tear on road surfaces, accelerating the deterioration process and increasing the likelihood of potholes forming.\nUtility trenches\nExcavation work for utility trenches can disrupt the integrity of the road surface, creating weak spots that can develop into potholes.\nExtreme temperatures\nExtreme heat and cold can also cause the road surface to expand and contract, leading to cracks and potholes.\nIdentifying potholes\nRoads in Knowsley are regularly inspected to ensure they remain in a safe condition. All defects are recorded and repaired in accordance with Knowsleyâs policy for highway safety inspections, available to download below.\nDocument\nKnowsley Council Policy for Highway Safety Inspections 2019.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n911.38KB\n)\nThe frequency of inspections is based on the road type and the traffic using it.\nTable 1: Carriageways\nCategory\nCategory name\nShort description\nLong description\nFrequency\n1\nMotorway\nLimited access motorway regulations apply\nRoutes for fast moving long distance traffic.

In urban areas speed limits are usually 40 mph or less, parking is restricted at peak times and there are positive measures for pedestrian safety.\nOneÂ month\n3b\nSecondary\nDistributor\nClassified Road (B and C class) and\nunclassified urban bus routes carrying local traffic with frontage access and frequent junctions\nIn rural areas these roads link the larger villages and HGV generators to the Strategic and Main Distributor Network. In built up areas these roads have 30 mph speed limits and very high levels of pedestrian activity with some crossing facilities including zebra crossings. On street parking is generally unrestricted except for safety reasons.\nOneÂ month\n4a\nLink Road\nRoads linking between the Main and Secondary Distributor Network with frontage access and frequent junctions\nIn rural areas these roads link the smaller villages to the distributor roads.

These are not necessarily the responsibility of the highway authority but may be maintained by an authority under other powers or duties.\n12 monthly\nPotholes and other defects may occur between these inspections, particularly following adverse weather conditions. This is why people must report them.\nResponse times for repairing potholes\nThe severity of the pothole and the urgency of repair is determined by the risk it poses to road users. Factors taken into account include location, size and depth of pothole; traffic type, speed and volume; road type, alignment and visibility; and also the position to cycle trails and leisure routes through open spaces. road width.\nCategory 1\nDefects that represent an immediate or imminent hazard, where not providing an immediate response could significantly endanger the safety of road users, will be made safe or repaired withinÂ two hours.\nCategory 2\nDefects that fall within the investigation levels below will be made safe or repaired within 24 hours.\nCategory 3\nDefects that fall within the investigation levels below will be made safe or repaired within 14 days.\nCategory 4\nDefects that fall within the investigation levels below will be made safe or repaired within 28 days.\nHow potholes are repaired\nRepairs will be completed within the timescales above and carried out by the councilâs term maintenance contractor.\nPermanent repairs will be carried out straight away. In some circumstances, a temporary repair is carried out as a short-term measure, with a permanent repair scheduled soon after.\nTemporary repairs will also be considered when there are extensive patching or resurfacing works programmed.\nA typical permanent repair would see the area of the road around the pothole cut out to give a clean vertical edge. Any loose material is removed from the area being repaired and is then painted with liquid bituminous binder. The area is filled with a hot bitumen-bound material, which is raked and compacted to the level of the surrounding road.\nPerformance management\nPerformance will be monitored and managed appropriately with the aim of achieving the following response times:\nResponse category\nResponse times\nTarget % repaired\nCategory 1\n1 - 2 hours\n98%\nCategory 2\n2 - 24 hours\n95%\nCategory 3\n3 - 14 days\n95%\nCategory 4\n4 - 28 days\n95%\nHow repairs are paid for\nPothole inspections and repairs are funded from Knowsley Councilâs highway maintenance budget and from theÂ governmentâs Pothole Action Fund.\nMore information on how and where the pothole action funding was invested in Knowsley\n.\nHow to report a pothole\nPotholes and other defects can happen very fast, and the council may not be aware of them, so any reports are helpful.\nReported defects are assessed, and where they meet the intervention criteria set out in the Highway Safety Inspection Policy, then repairs will be undertaken.\nReport a pothole here\nor contact 0800 0232334.",

If you pay the PCN within 14 days, the penalty is reduced to Â£25 or Â£35. The levels of PCNs are set nationally.\nFind out more\nDocument\nGuide to Parking Enforcement.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n550.9KB\n)\nAppeals\nIf you want to appeal or challenge your Penalty Charge Notice (PCN), you must submit a written representation by.\nWriting to Knowsley MBC, PO Box 222, Sheffield, S98 1NX\nEmailing\npcn.knowsley@apcoa.com\nPlease quote your PCN Number, the vehicle registration and full address including post code in all contacts.\nIf you are unable to write or email or have any other enquiries, please telephone 0345 319 0430.\nThese instructions are also printed on the back of your PCN.\nRead more about our\nPolicy for the Enforcement and Cancellation of Penalty Charge Notices\n.\nParking permits\nIf you live or run a business in a Parking Permit Area, you can\napply for your parking permit online\n.\nTraffic Regulation Orders and our Setting of Charges Notice\nDocument\nKMBC On-Street CPE Order 2015.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n294.72KB\n)\nDocument\nKMBC Off-Street CPE Order 2015.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n289.35KB\n)\nDocument\nKMBC On-Street Consolidation Notice 2015.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n93.92KB\n)\nDocument\nKMBC Off-Street Consolidation Notice 2015.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n52.71KB\n)\nYou can view the current parking or waiting restrictions on any of\nKnowsleyâs roads here\n.\nMaps\nDocument\nHuyton Car Park Map.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n279.42KB\n)\nDocument\nKirkby Car Park Map.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n238.44KB\n)\nDocument\nPrescot Car Park Map.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n234.79KB\n)",

    "text": "We receive regular Met Office weather forecasts which help us identify when we need to grit. Gritting is usually complete within three hours of operations starting.\nRoads that are gritted\nSix primary routes, covering almost half of the roads in Knowsley, are gritted.Â  These include:\nM62 motorway (Liverpool boundary to Tarbock Interchange)\nAll strategic routes\nMajor bus routes\nTransport Interchanges and bus stations\nInterconnecting roads within important industrial areas\nRoads leading to ambulance, fire stations and hospitals\nRoads on significant hills/inclines and known trouble spots\nThe Council do not directly treat the footways in wintery conditions as this would be a labour-intensive job. However, when gritting the road network the grit is dispersed across the carriageway and footway.\nOur approach to winter gritting can be found in our Winter Service Policy.\nDocument\nWinter Service Policy Document.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n528.28KB\n)\nRoute maps\nDocument\nGritting routes.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n3.19MB\n)\nDocument\nGritting routes A-Z format.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n141.69KB\n)\nHow we decide which roads to grit\nSchools\nSchools often clear key pathways, access roads, and frontages. In very severe conditions, we may grit outside school gates if enough salt is available.\nMajor retail parks and supermarkets\nMajor retail parks and supermarkets normally grit their car parks and the areas outside their shops.\nGrit bins\nIn the early 2010s a decision was made for all council provided grit bins within the Borough to be removed due to ongoing issues which included being filled with litter, used to conceal illegal substances or people stockpiling grit/padlocking bins preventing others from accessing it.\nGritting product\nWe use a product called Safecote-treated 6mm Thawrox+ to treat the roads. This product has several advantages over regular rock salt:\nIt works longer than regular rock salt.\nIt works at temperatures as low as -10Â°C (regular rock salt only works down to -6Â°C).\nLess of the product is needed to treat roads, as it is more effective. This means there is less waste and that gritting vehicles do not need to return to the depot to be reloaded as often.\nSafecote reduces corrosion of the gritting vehicles.\nSafecote improves the distribution of salt on the highway by 35-40% compared to rock salt.\nSafecote allows us to start gritting earlier in the evening than we could with regular rock salt.\nReactive treatment\nIf snow and ice are forecast to last for 24 hours or more, we may consider requests for gritting in specific areas. However, we must balance these requests with our other priorities and our overall gritting schedule.\nWhere conditions of snow and or ice are forecast to persist for 24 hours or longer and where there are resources available, the council will consider requests in the context of competing priorities and programmed gritting operations. Â It should be noted that given the limited nature of the financial and other resources involved in delivering the winter service, it is neither reasonable nor possible to treat the entire public highway asset.\nWhat you can do\nYou can help us keep the roads safe during the winter by:\nHaving your own stock of salt to clear your driveway and sidewalk.\nClearing your driveway and sidewalk carefully and taking sensible precautions.\nHelping vulnerable or elderly neighbours clear their driveways and sidewalks.\nOnly driving when absolutely necessary and taking extreme care. Public transport is usually more reliable during the winter, and buses normally travel along main routes that are regularly gritted.\nStaying up-to-date with the weather forecast by watching and listening to local TV and radio stations.\nPlease note that we cannot treat the entire road network due to the limited resources available.\nRepairing damage caused by bad weather\nDamage to roads is caused by water and thawing snow seeping into small cracks in the road. As temperatures dip, the water freezes and expands, enlarging the cracks. This causes cracks and potholes to appear.\nInspection and repair works return the highway to a safe condition as quickly as possible.\nReporting a pothole\nwill help us identify and repair damage more quickly.\nFind out more\nFollow\nKnowsley Council on Facebook\nfor updates.",

    "text": "Venture into the heart of Knowsley and discover a network of Public Rights of Way (PRoWs), designated paths that offer a unique opportunity to connect with nature and immerse yourself in the region's rich heritage. These pathways, spanning approximately 53 kilometres, provide access to diverse landscapes, from peaceful woodlands to scenic country trails, offering a haven for walkers, runners, cyclists, and horse riders.\nUnderstanding PRoW classifications\nPRoWs are categorized into four distinct types based on the specific rights granted to the public:\nFootpaths\nPrimarily intended for pedestrians, footpaths are often surfaced with pavement or gravel, providing a comfortable and accessible route for exploring the countryside.\nBridleways\nDesigned for both pedestrians and horse riders, bridleways offer a wider and more rugged terrain, often featuring gates or stiles for controlled access.\nByways\nThese paths accommodate a variety of non-motorised traffic, including pedestrians, horse riders, and cyclists, offering a versatile option for traversing the countryside.\nRestricted Byways\nWhile allowing all forms of non-motorised traffic, restricted byways prohibit vehicles from making anything other than a slow and careful passage, ensuring the preservation of the path's integrity.\nPermissive paths\nBeyond the officially designated PRoWs, landowners may also grant permission for public use of their private land, creating permissive paths. While not legally binding, permissive paths offer an informal alternative for enjoying the countryside. It's advisable to seek permission from the landowner before using a permissive path, as they may impose restrictions or guidelines for safe and respectful use.\nA landowner proposing to create a permissive path should take legal advice in relation to:\nthe Occupiers Liability Act 1957 and\nthe duty of care that landowners are required to extend to visitors on their property\nMaintenance\nThe maintenance of PRoWs is shared between landowners and the local authority. Landowners are responsible for keeping the route free from obstructions and maintaining gates and stiles. The local authority, as the Highway Authority, is responsible for ensuring the overall condition of the path, including clearing surface vegetation, authorising stiles, gates, signposting, and way marking.\nIssues can be reported on the following number and email address:\nTelephone\n0151 443 3100\nEmail\nhighways@knowsley.gov.uk\nDevelopment and PRoW considerations\nDuring any development project, it's crucial to identify and respect the presence of PRoWs. Obstructing or altering a PRoW is a legal offense that could delay or hinder the completion of development plans.\nThe\ngovernment website\noffers guidance notes on this issue.\nLandowners and the council makingÂ additional routes\nLandowners and the Council can makeÂ available for public to use in the following ways:\nPublic Path Creation Agreements\nWhere the Council and a landowner agree they can enter into a public path creation agreement under Section 25 of the Highways Act 1980 for the voluntary dedication of a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway as a highway maintainable at the public expense.\nThe landowner can specify the status of the route they wish to dedicate, for example, footpath, bridleway or restricted byway and include existing limitations such as gates, stiles or width restrictions in the agreement.\nThe Council will require anyone dedicating a new route by a creation agreement to show that they have the power to do so. This usually means supplying proof of ownership of the land in question.\nNotice of a creation agreement must be advertised in at least one local newspaper\nThe power to enter into a creation agreement is a discretionary one.Â  When deciding whether to enter into a creation agreement the Council will take into account factors including the benefit to the public of the public right of way which the landowner will dedicate, and the costs to the Council of bringing the right of way into public use.\nPublic Path Creation Orders\nWhere a new public right of way is needed by the public, section 26 of the 1980 Highways Act gives local councils compulsory powers for the creation of footpaths,Â  bridleways and restricted byways.\nUnder section 28 of the Highways Act compensation may be payable to any relevant parties for loss caused by a public path creation order.\nWhen deciding whether to make a public path creation order the Council must consider both:\nthe extent to which the path orÂ wayÂ would add to the convenience or enjoyment of a substantial section of theÂ public, or to the convenience of residents in the area; and\nthe effect that theÂ creationÂ of the path would have on theÂ rightsÂ of those interested in the land, taking into account the fact that compensation may be paid parties who suffer loss as a result and balance theÂ publicÂ interest in the path being created against the private interest of the landowner/occupier.\nA creation order can be unconditional or subject to limitations or conditions.\nAnyone may object to a creation order.Â  If objections are lodged and not withdrawn, the Secretary of State will call aÂ publicÂ inquiry or aÂ publicÂ hearing to determine whether the creation order should be confirmed.\nIf a creation order is confirmed the route will become a highway maintainable at the public expense.\nLand protection / Landowners Deposits\nNew Rights Of Way can be created through 20 years of unchallenged public use of paths. Â However Section 31(6) of the Highways Act 1980, allows landowners to show that they accept the Public Rights Of Way already recorded over their land, but, do not intend to dedicate any new ones by depositing a Statement and plan with the Council. Â Within 20 years a landowner may deposit a Highway Declaration to confirm that no new Rights of Way have been dedicated sinceÂ the date of the deposit of the map and Statement. Â Any public use of the land during this period will not count towards the establishment of a new Public Right Of Way. Â These Landowner Deposits are available for public inspection.\nSection 15A of the Commons Act 2006 now allows landowners to protect themselves against claims for village green rights over their land, in a similar way. Â The deposits under these two sections have been combined into Application Form CA16, and landowners can use all or only part of the form, depending on what rights they wish to claim. Â The forms need to be renewed every 20 years.\nThe application Form CA16, including Guidance notes,\ncan be found on the following government website here\n.\nFees\nThere is a charge for registering the Landowner Deposits to cover the Councilâs costs of logging the application, making it available on our website and register, placing notices on site and sending notifications, in line with the regulations.\nFor details,\nplease see the Councilâs webpage here.\nRegister Section 31(6) Highways Act 1980\nThe Council is required to keep a public register of highway statements and highway declarations that have been deposited under Section 31(6) of the 1980 Highways Act. Â These statements and declarations enable landowners to formally acknowledge public rights of way across their land and, in doing so, create a presumption that they have no intention to dedicate any further routes across their land.\nThe Register contains deposits received since 1 October 2013.\nEach deposit can be viewed below, or the paper copy can be viewed, by appointment.\nTo arrange an appointment or for any other enquiries, please contact us\nhighwaydc@knowsley.gov.uk\nRegister 31 (6) and all submissions\nRef.no.\nDeposit Date\nSite Notices: CA17\nDocument\nAA - Register 31(6) Highways Act 1980 â all applications.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n183.98KB\n)\n-\n-\n-\nDocument\nRed Cut Lane, Kirkby and Cronton Hall Sewage Works, Cronton.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n648.52KB\n)\n2017/2\n7/6/17\nDocument\nCA17-Notice-Cronton-Hall-and-Red-Cut-Ln-ref-2017-2-pdf.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n204.06KB\n)\nDocument\nWheathill Farm, Huyton, Hall Lane, Cronton and Norlandâs Lane, Cronton.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n695.94KB\n)\n2017/1\n7/6/17\nDocument\nCA17-Notice-Norlands-Ln-and-Wheathill-Rd-ref-2017-1-pdf.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n206.51KB\n)\nDocument\nDeclaration - Red Cut Lane, Kirkby and Cronton Hall Sewage Works, Cronton.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n505.3KB\n)\n2017/2\n18/12/17\nDocument\nCA17-Notice-Declaration-ref-2017-2-PDF_1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n203.48KB\n)\nDocument\nDeclaration - Wheathill Farm, Huyton, Hall Lane, Cronton and Norlands Lane, Cronton.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n576.14KB\n)\n2017/1\n18/12/17\nDocument\nCA17-Notice-Declaration-ref-2017-1-PDF.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n206.69KB\n)\nApply for a Definitive Map Modification Order under Section 53(2) Wildlife Countryside Act 1981\nYou may wish to apply for a definitive map modification order (DMMO) if you have evidence that:\nA path or way that you and others have been using as a right of way for years isÂ not shown\nA path shown with a particular description should be shown as a highway of aÂ different description, for example where a footpath has been used for many years by horse riders and you wish to apply to have it recorded as a bridleway\nThere isÂ no public right of wayÂ over land shown in the map and statement of any description, or it is in theÂ wrong place\nAnyÂ other particularsÂ in the map and statementÂ require modification.\nThe evidence may be in the form of historical documents or use by the public, or both.

    "text": "Knowsley offers two types of parking options:\nShort-stay car parks\nThese are designed for parking durations of up to three hours (excluding Kirkby Market car park, which has a maximum stay of one hour).\nLong-stay car parks\nThese allow parking for up to nine hours.\nPlease note that while there are no parking fees in Knowsley Council car parks, there are clear regulations that must be adhered to. Failure to do so could result in a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) of Â£50 or Â£70 (reduced to Â£25 or Â£35 if paid within 14 days), respectively. The national government sets these penalty charges.\nTake a look at theÂ Guide to Parking Enforcement below to find out more.\nDocument\nGuide to Parking Endforcement.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n550.9KB\n)\nDisabled parking\nDisabled spaces are clearly marked. Blue badge holders are allowed one additional hour in addition to the standard maximum parking times.\nPlease note that currently, those with blue badges will be able to use them to park in appropriate locations for an additional four months beyond the expiration date displayed on the badge. No enforcement action will be taken in these circumstances, as long as the full blue badge (including the correctly set clock) is properly displayed in the vehicle. This concession is in place while the Council addresses the high volume of blue badge applications in the system, and it is likely to be reviewed in the future.\nPlease note this applies only when parking on car parks operated by Knowsley Council, and you may be penalised by landowners if displaying an expired blue badge when parking elsewhere.\nCouncil car park locations\nHuyton\nLathom Road multi-storey car park (short stay: levels 1 and 2, long stay: levels 3 â 7)\nSee disability access information\nArchway Road (short stay)\nHuyton Hey (long stay)\nRed, Green and Brown Zone (long stay, also available as short stay at weekends)\nDocument\nHuyton-Parking-Map.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n5.64MB\n)\nCar parks open to the public but privately owned are also available at:\nClub 3000 Bingo, Ellison Grove (charge)\nCavendish Walk underground, Lathom Road (charge)\nASDA Supermarket, Huyton Lane (no charge, maximum 3 hours)\nKirkby\nKirkby multi-storey car park, Norwich Way (short stay: levels 1 â 2, long stay: levels 3 â 8)\nKirkby Town Centre (short stay)\nKirkby Market (short stay, maximum 1 hour)\nKirkby Centre (short stay)\nCherryfield Drive (short and long stay areas â please see local signage)\nSt Chads Drive (long stay)\nTelegraph Way (long stay)\nCar parks open to the public but privately owned are also available at:\nB & M Store car park (short stay, 90 mins)\nMcDonalds (short stay, 90 mins)\nDocument\nKirkby town centre parking map.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.67MB\n)\nPrescot\nMill Street (short stay)\nPrescot Shopping Centre (short and long stay available)\nCyprus Street (short and long stay available)\nMoss Street (short and long stay available)\nCar parks open to the public but privately owned are also available at:\nCables Shopping Park (no charge)\nDeanes House (charge)\nChatwinâs Bakery (charge)\nMcDonalds (short stay, 90 mins)\nDocument\nPrescot Car Park Map.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n367.31KB\n)\nCycle park locations\nSecure bicycle parking is available at designated locations across Knowsley:\nCronton\nThe Shopping Parade\nParish Council\nHalewood\nHalewood Leisure Centre\nHalewood Library\nHalewood Primary Care Centre\nHalewood Train Station\nHalewood Environment Centre\nNew Hutte Neighbourhood Centre\nHuyton\nOpposite the War Memorial\nHuyton Train Station\nKing George V Sports Complex\nKnowsley Leisure and Culture Park\nHuyton Library\nHuyton Municipal Buildings\nHuyton Shopping Centre\nBluebell Lane Medical Practice\nAldi / Starbucks / KFC / Shell Coppice Lane\nTesco PFS Cronton Road\nKMBC Stretton Way\nAsda Super Centre\nHuyton Primary Care Centre\nHillside Road Shopping Parade\nAcacia Avenue Shopping Parade\nKnowsley Community College\nDinas Lane Medical Centre\nCourt Hey Park\nRoby Train Station\nKirkby\nAdmin Road / South Boundary Road\nKirkby Town Centre\nKirkby Library\nKirkby Train Station\nBewley Drive Shopping Parade\nBroad Lane Shopping Parade\nCopple House Lane Shopping Parade\nGlovers Brow Shopping Parade\nOld Rough Lane Shopping Parade\nPark Brow Drive Shopping Parade\nJames Holt Avenue Shopping Parade\nKennelwood Avenue Shopping Parade\nLoweswater Way Shopping Parade\nOld Farm Road Shopping Parade\nRichard Hesketh Drive\nCentre 63\nKnowsley Village\nKnowsley Village Hall\nSugar Lane Shopping Parade\nPage Moss\nNorth Huyton Primary Care Resource Centre (Page Moss)\nRiver Alt Resource Centre\nPrescot\nCables Retail Park\nPrescot Shopping Centre\nPrescot Town Centre Eccleston Street\nPrescot Town Hall\nShakespeare North Playhouse\nPrescot Train Station\nPrescot Soccer Centre\nPrescot Parkway at Home Bargains\nStockbridge Village\nStockbridge Village Library and Shopping Centre\nPrimary Care Resource Centre (Stockbridge)\nLeisure Centre\nTarbock\nParish Council Building\nWhiston\nWhiston Hospital\nWarrington Road Shopping Parade\nWhiston Town Council and Community Centre\nWhiston Primary Care Centre and Pharmacy\nWhiston Train Station\nMilton Avenue Shopping Parade\nWhiston Village (Greenes Road)\nGetting around in Knowsley\nIf you want to know more about cycling in Knowsley, as well as walking and public transport in Knowsley travel information page\nGetting Around in Knowsley\n.",

    "text": "An abandoned vehicle appears not to be in regular use and has been in the same place for some time, usually two weeks or more.\nThere may also be visible damage to suggest a crash or signs the vehicle has been stolen, such as:\nsignificant damage\nit has no tax and/or MOT\nit's run-down or unroadworthy, including being rusted\nmissing or suspicious number plates\nbroken windows, flat tyres\nhas a lot of rubbish inside it\nbroken or loose ignition\nbroken steering column\nAbandoned vehicles can cause a nuisance by obstructing roads, traffic and pedestrians. The sight of a damaged or slowly rusting car can also be an eyesore in your community, so, understandably, you might want it to be removed.\nAbandoned and nuisance vehicles can often be confused. Just because a vehicle is in poor condition or out of tax does not always mean it is abandoned. So, on occasions, additional enquiries may have to be made to find out if the vehicle really is abandoned before the Council can remove it.\nIf the vehicle is abandoned, we will place a notice on the vehicle to inform the owner that the vehicle will be removed within 15 days of the notice being placed if, within that time, there has been no contact from the owner and the vehicle is still present, we will instruct a third-party contractor to remove the vehicle.\nBefore continuing to report the vehicle as abandoned, please check the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) website by clicking\nhere\nto find out if the vehicle is taxed.\nIf the vehicle is not taxed, you need to report this directly to the DVLA by visiting their website and following the instructions set out on their\nwebsite\n. The report is anonymous and will be investigated by the DVLA.\nAll vehicles that are not abandoned but are causing an obstruction or are dangerously parked, irrespective of whether the vehicle is taxed or not, must be reported to Merseyside Police, who can arrange for the vehicle to be dealt with immediately.\nFor further information, please visit the\nMerseyside Police website\nor call the non-emergency contact number 101.\nHow to report an abandoned vehicle to Knowsley Council\nIf the vehicle fits the above criteria for an abandoned vehicle and you have checked the DVLA website to confirm if the vehicle is taxed, then please click the link below and complete the online form to report the abandoned vehicle to us; you will need to provide details such as:\nThe location of the vehicle\nThe make, model and colour\nThe registration number\nThe state of the vehicle, including any damage\nHow long it has been there\nPlease have these details ready to complete the form.\nStart here",

    "text": "What is a dropped kerb\nA dropped kerb enables vehicles to cross the public pavement (footway/verge) to access a private driveway. It allows safe, off-road parking and could add value to your property.\nThe dropped kerb access area remains part of the public highway and is maintained by the council. Utility apparatus, such as electricity and phone equipment within this area is maintained by the utility company such as Virgin Media and Scottish Power.\nThe dropped kerb and access across the footway do not become part of your land and must not be used for parking vehicles, as overhanging orÂ obstructing a public footway is an offence.\nRequirements for dropped kerbs\nDriveway and planning considerations:\nTo qualify for a dropped kerb, you'll need space for a driveway on your property with a minimum size of 5.5 meters long by 3 meters wide to accommodate vehicle parking. The driveway must be in place before a dropped kerb can be constructed.\nStandard dropped kerbs are 3.6 meters wide, with an additional 0.9 meters on each side for transition curbs. The entire area from the kerb to your property will be strengthened to take the weight of a vehicle. Strengthening involves excavating and rebuilding the footpath to an appropriate thickness, often using concrete slabs.\nAny existing street furniture or utility equipment will need to be moved at your own expense.\nIf you request an extension to an existing dropped kerb, the existing section won't be automatically renewed. Renewing the entire area will incur additional costs. Please contact us before applying to discuss your options.\nPlanning permission might be required if you request a dropped kerb on a classified road (typically major roads).\nApplication\nTo request a quote for a dropped kerb, please contact our contractor, Tarmac.\nTelephone\n0800 023 2334\nEmail\nknowsley.highways@tarmac.com\nProcess\nTarmac will assess your request and provide a quotation outlining the next steps, including form submission and payment options. Once the process is complete you will receive an invoice from Knowsley Council, with a unique reference, and details on how you can pay. Once weâve received payment, we will instruct Tarmac to proceed with the works.\nPlease note that we may decline certain requests if the driveway lacks sufficient parking space, has visibility concerns, or could negatively impact parking for surrounding properties. Each request is evaluated individually, and the cost reflects the specific details of your property.\nAccess protection markings\nAn access protection (h-bar) marking will not be included in your dropped crossing quote unless you request it.\nFind out more about requesting this marking here.\nUsing your own contractor\nIf you decide to use your own contractor itâs your responsibility to make sure that they:\nApply to us for SectionÂ 171 permitÂ before they start any work, you will need to give them the reference number we gave you when we approved your request.\nTo apply for a Section 171 permit, contact\nNRSWA.Team@knowsley.gov.uk\n.\nHold public liability insurance of at least Â£10 million, which indemnifies you and us.\nEmploy trained and accredited workers in line with the codes of practice in the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.\nAccept and keep to any conditions which we set, for example saying that work can only take place during certain times, and any costs relating to this.\nAccept a two-year maintenance period after the work is done, the contractor and you will be responsible for any claims.\nGive us update notices confirming when the work has started and finished, and the registration of all reinstatement dimensions.\nGive us 20 days notice before the work starts.\nPlan the work out properly, and complete it efficiently.\nConstruct the works to the requirements set out in the\nHighways Construction Details\n.\nBefore any works commence, you must contact the council at\nknowsley.highways@tarmac.com\nfor an inspection quotation. The authority is required to check all the works and there is a charge for this service. This charge differs depending on the extent of the works.",
