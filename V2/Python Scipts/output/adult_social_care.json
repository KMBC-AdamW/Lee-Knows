However, abuse can sometimes lead to self-neglect. Self-neglect can be a complex and difficult issue to deal with because it is important to respect the person's right to make their own choices, but it is also important to protect their health and well-being.\nThe Mental Capacity Act 2005 is a law that helps to decide what action can be taken in cases of self-neglect.\nHere are some signs of self-neglect\nPoor personal hygiene, such as not bathing or changing clothes regularly\nNot eating or drinking enough\nNot taking medication as prescribed\nLiving in a dirty or cluttered environment\nHoarding animals or objects\nIt is important to remember that self-neglect is a serious issue, but it is one that can be helped.

You should expect to pay towards the cost of support services unless your assets, savings and income are very low.\nA social care assessment is the way we decide if you have needs that we can support you with. This is called being eligible for care and support.\nDuring the assessment we will have a conversation with you about what things you can do for yourself, what is important to you and  what you want to achieve.\nWe will share information with you before the assessment about the eligibility criteria for care and support, and we will share the outcome of the assessment with you too.\nWe know from talking to our residents that people want to live independently, in their own homes, for as long as possible.\nOur approach\nIn Adult Social Care, our approach is focused on early intervention and prevention. We aim to support people to promote their wellbeing and enable them to be as independent as possible.\nThis support can include:\nproviding information and advice in a format that you would prefer\nreferrals to community-based support services such as community centres or services that can help you with tasks like shopping and cleaning\nproviding a high level of support for a short period of time, for example to help you recover after a period of illness or injury\nproviding you with equipment or technology enabled care tools, such as pendant alarms or medication dispensers, to help you remain independent in your own home\nproviding support and services in your own home including help with your personal care needs\nYou will often find that the support you need can be provided by your family or friends, but there is also lots of support available in your community to help you when you need it.

It also provides guidance on how others can make decisions on behalf of someone who lacks mental capacity. Any decisions made for someone who lacks mental capacity must be made in their best interest.\nSince April 2009, the Mental Capacity Act has also provided a legal framework to ensure that people who lack capacity who are being deprived of their liberty are being done so lawfully. This means that the deprivation of liberty must be authorised in accordance with the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).\nDoLS applies to people who are resident in a care or nursing home or hospital.

It helps you to be more independent and lead the life you want to live.\nIn Shared Lives we find and check out (approve) people who want to share their home and support someone. We call these people Shared Lives carers. You will be matched with a Shared Lives carer who you want to spend time with.\nUnlike other forms of care you may have used before, Shared Lives is different because you will not be supported in a Social Services building. Instead you will be based in the community, with care provided from the Shared Lives carer’s own home.\nSometimes you will live in your carer’s home for short periods of a few days, or one or two weeks. Or you might live with your carer for a longer period of time – months or even years.\nYou will also meet and get to know your carer first, before starting any Shared Lives arrangement. We always make sure you are happy with your carer first!\nIn most cases you will be supported individually by your carer. However they might also live with other family members, who you will get to know and spend time with.\nIn Shared Lives we put you at the very centre, and together we plan services with you that help you develop your skills and lifestyle. For example, you may be able to develop or continue any hobbies or things you like doing.",

    "text": "Overview\nAll people in England receiving Adult Social Care services should expect to pay for their care and support. You should expect to pay towards the cost of support services unless your assets, savings, and income are very low.\nCare and support is not a free service like the NHS. The Care Act 2014 provides a single legal framework and sets out a clear approach to charging for care and support. The Act gives the Council the power to charge for care and support, but the Council cannot charge for services which the regulations say must always be free, for example;\nintermediate care, including reablement, which must be provided free of charge for up to 6 weeks\ncommunity equipment (aids and minor adaptations). Aids must be provided free of charge whether provided to meet or prevent/delay needs. A minor adaptation is one costing £1,000 or less\ncare and support provided to people with Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease\nafter-care services/support provided under section 117 of the Mental Health Act 1983\nany service or part of service which the NHS is under a duty to provide. This includes Continuing Healthcare and the NHS contribution to Registered Nursing Care.\nYou can find out more about eligibility for this here\n.\nThe Council have a Charging Policy for Adult Social Care services which provides more information on the Councils approach to charging, and this is reviewed annually. You can view the policy below.\nDocument\nAdult Social Care Charging Policy April 2025.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n144.01KB\n)\nYou can also request a paper copy of this by contacting the Council on 0151 443 2600 or you can visit the following libraries across Knowsley and request a copy - Huyton, Halewood, Kirkby, Prescot and Stockbridge Village.\nHow does the Council decide if you need Adult Social Care services?\nA social care needs assessment is the way we decide if you have needs that we can support you with. This is called being eligible for care and support. During the assessment we will have a conversation with you about what things you can do for yourself, what is important to you and what you want to achieve. We will share information with you before the assessment about the eligibility criteria for care and support, and we will share the outcome of the assessment with you too.\nFollowing your social care needs assessment, and providing it is agreed that the Council will be arranging your care and support, the Council will contact you to arrange a financial assessment.  This will be carried out by the Financial Assessment and Charging Team. The team will also provide advice and information on benefits you might be able to get to help with your living costs.\nYour support will start when you need it. The financial assessment may take place after the support begins. You will be expected to pay from the day your care and support starts. Therefore, you may receive an initial bill where charges have been applied and backdated to the date the support started.\nWhat happens when I am discharged from hospital with a package of care and support?\nIn Adult Social Care, the Council’s approach to hospital discharge is focused on supporting people to regain independence through personalised approaches to care and support which actively promote choice and control. It is also important, in order to support our hospitals to manage demand, that once you are deemed ‘ready for discharge’, you are discharged with the right support in place.\nIf you need a package of care and support after being in hospital, the Council will complete a social care needs assessment with you to help them understand what care and support you need. Some of the support you receive when leaving hospital may be free of charge during the period of assessment only. Once all assessments have been completed, you may be required to pay to the cost of any ongoing care and support.\nIf you are being discharged from hospital to a care home and your preferred choice is not immediately available, you will not be able to remain in the hospital and the hospital may enforce their 'No Choice Policy'. This means that where a move to a care home is needed to enable a discharge from hospital, you will be transferred to an appropriate care home until your home of choice becomes available. This is not a Council policy. If you have any concerns about your discharge arrangements, please speak to a member of staff on the ward.\nWhen you are discharged the Council will contact you to arrange a financial assessment to work out how much you will pay for your care and support.",

The financial assessment calculates the maximum that you can be expected to pay for support services which are provided to you.\nIf you have more than £23,250 in savings or other investments, you will be expected to pay the full cost of your care and support services. If you own the property that you live in, it will only be considered if you no longer live there as your main home, for example, if you move into a care home to meet your needs.\nYour support will start when you need it. Your financial assessment may take place after the support begins.  You will be expected to pay from the day your support starts. Therefore, you may receive an initial bill where charges have been applied and backdated to the date your support started.\nIf you are having difficulty paying your bills, please tell us as soon as possible. We may be able to offer you information or advice which could prevent you getting behind with your bills or falling into debt. If you have any queries about making payment for your care please ring the Sundry Debtor Team on 0151 443 4455.",

The pendant works both inside and outside your home.\nWhat happens when you press the button\nTo use a lifeline alarm, simply press the button on the alarm unit or pendant. This will send a signal to the alarm monitoring centre, where a trained operator will answer your call and assess the situation. The operator can then call for help, such as an ambulance or the fire department, or they can contact your family or friends.\nLifeline alarms are a great way to stay safe and independent, especially if you live alone or have health problems. They can give you peace of mind knowing that help is always just a button press away.",

These plans are part of a new approach called Special Educational Needs and Disability Reforms. This approach aims to join up support across education, health, and care.\nFrom September 2014, children and young people assessed as needing an EHC plan will have the option of a personal budget. This means that money from education, health, and social care can be brought together into a single budget.\nNot all children will be eligible for a personal budget.

This meeting is called an introduction and normally takes place either in your own home or in the home of the Shared Lives Carer.\nIf you are both happy you will agree to start a partnership.\nAt this point your Shared Lives worker will draw up a Partnership Agreement with you and your carer. This is an agreement between you and your carer about how you would like to be supported.\nCan you say NO? If you are not happy with your Shared Lives carer, or do not want to continue with your arrangement at any stage, even after you have started living with someone, you can say NO. To speak to someone about your Shared Lives arrangement at any time, you can telephone the office on 0151 443 2060, between the hours of 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday, and speak to your Shared Lives worker.\nReview meetings: Your Shared Lives worker will talk to you about how things are going after a short period (usually within one month).

    "text": "Paying for care provided in your own home or in the community\nWhat services do I have to pay for?\nYou will be charged for most services arranged by the Council. Care provided in your own home or in the community could include:\nHome care services\nDay care services\nSupported living\nDirect payments\nExtra care housing\nTechnology enabled care\nHow will the amount I have to pay be calculated?\nAn assessor from the Financial Assessment and Charging Team will contact you to gather the following:\nInformation about your income and savings\nInformation about household costs you must pay, such as your mortgage or rent, and costs for Council Tax\nInformation about costs that you incur specifically because of your disability related needs which are not met by the Council\nThe financial assessment will ensure that you retain a basic level of income known as the Minimum Income Guarantee, this is to ensure you can meet your daily living costs, such as food and utilities\nAll of this information will be used to work out the maximum that you can be expected to pay. The Council will write to you to confirm the outcome and provide a copy of your financial assessment.\nWhat are disability related expenses?\nDisability related expenditure is additional expense that a person has to pay due to a disability or condition to meet needs that are not being met by the Council. This will be discussed as part of your Social Care Needs Assessment and Financial Assessment.\nIf you are in receipt of benefits such as Personal Independence Payments (Daily Living component), Disability Living Allowance (Care component), Attendance Allowance, or have a Severe Disability Premium you will receive a disregard of either 10% of the value of those benefits or the evidenced cost of your actual disability related expenditure if that is more.\nExpenditure must be reasonable and verified for example with receipts. Where expenditure cannot be verified or where reasonable alternatives are available at a lower cost or for free, the expense may not be included or may be restricted to a lower cost determined by the Council.\nWhat happens if I own my own home?\nIf you own the property that you live in, it will only be considered as an asset if you no longer live there as your main home, for example, if you move into an extra care setting or a care home to meet your needs.\nIf you move into an Extra Care setting, and you owned your former home, this will usually be included in your financial assessment. If your property is included in the financial assessment and you do not intend to sell your former home, more information will be provided during your financial assessment about your eligibility for Deferred Payments.\nThere is also more\ninformation on Deferred Payments here\n.\nHow do I pay?\nYou will receive an invoice every four weeks from the Council’s Sundry Debtor Team advising that payment is now due and explaining that payment can be made in several ways: online via the Council’s website, bank transfer, by telephone and by post. Invoices are issued in arrears; this means you make payment after receiving your care and support.\nYour invoice will be based on the services you have received, how much they cost, and the amount you have been asked to pay towards your care and support.  It is important to note that you will be charged for any care that has not been cancelled with notice. For example, if a carer visits your home and you decide, when they arrive, that you do not need the care.\nAny queries around being charged for care that you do not feel has been provided should be raised with your care provider in the first instance.\nIf you receive a direct payment, the amount you need to pay will be deducted from your direct payment, and you will need to pay the difference into your direct payment account.\nIf you are having difficulty paying your bills, please tell the Council as soon as possible who may be able to offer you information and advice which could prevent you getting behind with your bills or falling into debt. If you have any queries about making payment for your care, please ring the Council’s Sundry Debtor Team on 0151 443 4455.",

    "text": "Paying for care provided in a residential or nursing home\nWhat services do I have to pay for?\nYou will be charged for most services arranged by the Council. Care provided in a residential or nursing home could include:\nRespite and short-term care – when you stay in a care home for no longer than eight weeks\nResidential and Nursing Care Home – when you move permanently into a care home\nResidential and Nursing Care Home – when you stay temporarily in a care home for up to 52 weeks\nHow will the amount I have to pay be calculated for Respite and short-term care?\nIf you have a period of respite or short-term care, and you do not have more than £23,250 in savings and investments, you will be charged a fixed amount for the respite or short-term care. The Council will not contact you to carry out a financial assessment, you will be advised during your Social Care Needs Assessment of the amount you will be required to pay.\nThe fixed amount used by the Council is set nationally by the government every year. This is because carrying out a full financial assessment would be disproportionate for short term or temporary care arrangements.\nIf you are having difficulty paying the fixed amount you can request a full financial assessment which will consider your income, savings and any ongoing expenses. You can request this during your social care needs assessment.\nHow will the amount I have to pay be calculated for longer term Residential or Nursing care?\nIf you remain in a care home for more than eight weeks, or move permanently into a care home, an assessor from the Financial Assessment and Charging Team will contact you to gather the following:\nInformation about your income and savings\nInformation about household costs you must pay, such as your mortgage or rent, and costs for Council Tax when you own your own home\nThe financial assessment will ensure that you retain a basic level of income known as the Personal Expenses Allowance, this is to ensure you have money to spend on personal items, such as clothes and other items that are not part of your care\nAll of this information will be used to work out the maximum that you can be expected to pay. The Council will write to you to confirm the outcome and provide a copy of your financial assessment.\nWhat happens if I own my own home?\nIf you are staying permanently in a care home, your property will usually be included in your financial assessment. However, there are some examples where a property may not be included:\nIf your property has been continuously lived in by your spouse, civil partner, or partner\nIf your property has been continuously lived in by a relative who is aged 60 or over\nIf your property has been continuously lived in by a relative under the age of 60 who has a disability\nThe Council must not include the value of your main or only home for the first 12 weeks of permanent residential or nursing care.\nIf your property is included in the financial assessment, you may be eligible for a Deferred Payment Arrangement.\nHow do I pay?\nYou will receive an invoice from your care home advising that payment is now due and giving you options on how to make payment.\nYou may want to make payment to the home whilst waiting for your financial assessment to be carried out. This will prevent you receiving a backdated bill in the case of any delays. Should you wish to do this you can discuss paying a standard weekly contribution rate with the care home.\nIf you are having difficulty paying your bills, please discuss this with the care home as soon as possible. The care home will contact the Council to make them aware if necessary.\nWhat is a Deferred Payment?\nIf you have been assessed as having to pay the full cost of your care, but you cannot pay the full amount because your money is tied up in property, the Council may accept your property as security. You will continue to pay a weekly contribution towards the cost of your care and support based on your income and savings only. The amount you cannot pay will be paid by the Council and a debt will build up, known as a deferred payment. This debt will then have to be paid at a later date, for example, when you sell your property. If you choose a deferred payment, it is important to note that interest and charges will apply.\nMore information will be provided during your financial assessment if you are eligible for a Deferred Payment.\nDo I get a choice about which care home I live in?\nIf you're paying for your own care, you can choose which care home to live in. If you choose to live in an out of borough care home, whilst paying for your own care, you will usually become ordinarily resident in that area. This means that any future requests for support with funding your care and support needs should be made to the Council where the care home is situated.\nIf the Council are paying some or all of your care costs, you still have the right to choose your care home, provided that:\nthe accommodation is suitable in relation to your assessed needs\nto do so would not cost the Council more than the amount they usually pay for accommodation of that type\nthe accommodation is available\nthe provider of the accommodation is willing to enter into a contract with the Council to provide the care on their terms and conditions\nThe Council must ensure at least one accommodation option is available and affordable.\nIf you are being discharged from hospital to a care home and your preferred choice is not immediately available, you will not be able to remain in the hospital. You will be transferred to an appropriate care home until your home of choice becomes available.\nWhat happens if there are additional costs or ‘top up’ payments?\nIn some cases, you may choose a care home that is more expensive than a care home that has been identified by the Council as able to meet your needs. Where you have chosen a care home that costs more, an arrangement will need to be made as to how the difference will be met. This is known as an additional cost or ‘top-up’ payment and is the difference between the cost of the care home identified by the Council and the cost of the care home you have chosen.\nYou may still be able to choose alternative options including an out of borough care home or a more expensive setting, where a top-up fee is required, however the top-up will need to be met by a third-party, i.e., a friend or relative. There are some instances when a person can top up their own care home fees. This will be discussed, if applicable, during the financial assessment.",

    "text": "General information about financial assessments\nWhat is a financial assessment?\nThe financial assessment calculates the maximum that you can be expected to pay for support services which are provided to you.\nIn England, Councils have upper and lower capital limits for financial help. Examples of capital include, bank account balances, bonds, stocks and shares, trust funds, buildings or land.\nThe table below explains the limits.\nIf you have savings\nWhat you will have to pay\nOver £23,250\nYou will pay the full cost of your care and support\nBetween £14,250 and £23,250\nYou will pay a contribution from your income (such as pensions), plus a tariff income*, and we will contribute towards your care and support.\nUnder £14,250\nYou will pay a contribution from your income (such as pensions), with no tariff income*, and we will contribute towards your care and support.\n* The Council assumes that you get income each week from your capital, and this is included in your total weekly income. This is called 'tariff income'.\nTariff income assumes you have an extra £1 per week in income for every £250 (or part of) you have in capital between £14,250 and £23,250. For example, if you had £15,000 in capital this equals £750 more than the lower capital limit of £14,250, therefore you would pay £3 a week in tariff income.\nOnly the income and savings of the person receiving care and support is included in their financial assessment. If any income, benefits or savings are awarded jointly only 50% will be taken into account in your financial assessment.\nPlease refer to example 2\n.\nIf you own the property that you live in, it will only be considered as an asset if you no longer live there as your main home, for example, if you move into extra care or a care home to meet your needs.\nWhat happens if I do not want to tell you about my finances?\nIf you choose not to tell us about your finances or have a financial assessment, you will be assessed as able to pay and be invoiced for the full cost of your care and support services.\nHow will the financial assessment be arranged?\nThis will usually be a telephone call but can be arranged as a face-to-face appointment if that is required.\nThe Council want to make sure you can understand the information it shares with you. The financial assessment team will contact you to arrange your financial assessment. If you find it hard to read the Council’s letters or if you need someone to support you at appointments, please let the Council know.\nIf you need information in an alternative format, such as braille, large print, easy read, or interpretation /advocacy services the Council can arrange support to help you.\nCan somebody attend the financial assessment with me?\nYes, you can have people with you to support you and offer their views. This could be a carer, family member or friend, or anyone else that you trust.\nIf you think you will find the financial assessment process difficult and you don’t have anyone to help you, you can arrange for someone called an advocate to attend the assessment to help you get your views across.  If you think this would be helpful you can contact Knowsley’s Advocacy Hub on 0300 3030 624 and tell them you need help with a financial assessment.\nMental capacity is the ability to make an informed decision based on understanding a situation, the options available, and the consequences of the decision. While you are still able to make decisions and express your views, you should think how you want your affairs dealt with if you lose mental capacity in the future. You can create a Lasting Power of Attorney which grants legal authority to an attorney or attorneys to make decisions on your behalf if you lose mental capacity. There are 2 types of Lasting Power of Attorney, and you can choose to make one type or both:\nhealth and welfare – this can only be used when you’re unable to make your own decisions and gives an attorney the power to make decisions about things like your daily routine, for example washing, dressing, eating / medical care / moving into a care home / life-sustaining treatment\nproperty and financial affairs – this can be used as soon as it’s registered, with your permission, and gives an attorney the power to make decisions about money and property for you, for example: managing a bank or building society account / paying bills / collecting benefits or a pension / selling your home\nIf you lose mental capacity without a Lasting Power of Attorney in place, an application can be made for a deputyship with the Court of Protection. In certain circumstances the Council must appoint an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate to support and represent you if you lack the mental capacity to make a decision, for example about moving into a care home, and have no one to support you other than paid staff. All actions and decisions taken on your behalf must be made in your ‘best interests’ in line with the Mental Capacity Act 2005.\nIf you have concerns about an attorney or deputy, such as concerns about the misuse of money or decisions that are not in the best interests of the person they are responsible for, you should report these to the Office of the Public Guardian.\nYou can find more information about\nPower of Attorney and Court of Protection, including roles and responsibilities and reporting a concern, here\n.\nIf you lack mental capacity to manage your social security benefits, the Department for Work and Pensions can appoint someone else to make claims and receive benefits on your behalf. An appointee is usually a close friend or relative who visits you regularly. There are also organisations that can act as your appointee, for example, a solicitor. An appointee’s powers only extend to the management of social security benefits. You can find more information about\nbecoming an appointee, including roles and responsibilities if someone takes on this role, here.\nWhat if I give away something valuable?\nGiving away money or assets (can be capital or income), to avoid care charges is referred to as ‘deprivation of assets’. When the Council is considering whether there has been a deliberate deprivation of assets, it will consider the following:\nIf you knew you would need care and support at the time you gave away your assets\nIf you knew you would need to pay towards the cost of your care\nIf decreasing the amount you would pay for care and support was a significant reason for you giving away your assets\nIf you have given away some of your money or assets (eg. savings, income or property) to avoid or reduce how much you may pay for the cost of your care, the Council may assess you as if you still had it. The Council may include the full value of any money or assets you have given away in your financial assessment and charges will be applied as if you still have this money to pay towards care.\nIf you give away your savings, income, or property to a friend or relative, that person may become liable to pay the difference for the cost of your care.\nIf the Council think there has been a deliberate deprivation of assets, the Council will write to you to gather evidence to make a decision. The Council will make enquiries including obtaining a version of events from you or your representative before making decisions on deprivation of assets. The Council may also ask you to provide supporting evidence for your account. The Council must base its decision on facts and will write to you explaining its decision.\nMore information on the appeal and complaint process can be found below under the heading 'What should I do if I disagree with the assessment or need more information?' on this page.\nWhat if I am financially assessed to pay the full cost of care?\nThe outcome of your financial assessment will determine your maximum weekly charge. The amount you pay will be based on the care that you receive. If the cost of your care and support is less than your assessed maximum charge, then you will only be charged the actual cost of your care and support services. If you receive additional care above what is planned, then you could be charged the cost of this additional care. It is important to note that you will be charged for any care that has not been cancelled with notice. For example, if a carer visits your home and you decide, when they arrive, that you do not need the care.\nIf your capital is more than £23,250 or you do not want to disclose your financial information, then you will be assessed as able to pay and be invoiced for the full cost of your care and support services.\nIf you are financially assessed to pay the full cost of the care and support you receive at home, you can choose to enter into a private arrangement with the care provider or you can choose for the Council to arrange the care on your behalf.\nIf you are financially assessed to pay the full cost of the care and support you receive in a care home, you will usually be under a private arrangement with the care home.\nThe Council reviews the rates that are paid to care providers each year. This may affect the amount you are charged for your care and support.\nWhat happens if I do not pay my social care charges?\nYou have a responsibility to respond to requests for information in relation to financial assessment applications and reviews, ensure invoices are paid in full and on time, and report any changes in financial circumstances promptly.\nIf you do not pay the amount that you have been assessed to pay, this may result in further action being taken to recover the debt you owe to the Council.\nWhat should I do if my financial circumstances change?\nYou must notify the Council of a change to financial circumstances as these can affect your financial assessment. A change in circumstances could include:\nIncome, including Department for Work and Pensions benefits\nCapital\nHousehold expenses, i.e., rent, mortgage\nDisability related expenses\nPlease note this is not an exhaustive list and you should notify the Council of any changes to your financial circumstances as soon as possible.\nYour financial assessment will be revised, and you will be notified of any change in your weekly charge.\nIf you do not inform the Council of a change and, as a result of that change the amount you have to pay would increase, it will be backdated to the date the change took effect.\nWill my financial assessment be reviewed?\nThe Council will review your financial assessment every 12 months. This is done in April each year following annual increases to Department for Work and Pensions benefits which will impact the amount you pay.\nIf your financial circumstances change at any other time, you must notify the Council as this can affect your financial assessment. If you do not inform the Council of a change and, as a result of that change the amount you have to pay would increase, it will be backdated to the date the change took effect.\nThe Council will write to you to let you know the outcome of any reviews, including any changes to applied charges, and provide a copy of your financial assessment.\nWhat should I do if I disagree with the assessment or need more information?\nIf you do not understand how your charge has been worked out, or you do not agree with the amount you have to pay, you should contact the Financial Assessment and Charging Team who can explain the calculation to you. You can also ask for the assessment to be reviewed.\nIt is important that you continue to pay whilst a review is being considered.\nWhere a disagreement or complaint occurs, the Council will work with you to resolve it and this may involve a review of the financial assessment, an independent review by a senior/manager within the Financial Assessment and Charging Team, or a complaint.\nYou can submit a complaint to the Customer Liaison Team in the following ways:\nComplete the online form at:\nhttps://www.knowsley.gov.uk/contact-us/have-your-say/make-complaint-about-council\nWrite to Customer Liaison Team, Knowsley Council, Nutgrove Villa, Westmorland, Huyton, L36 6GA\nBy phone 0151 443 3231",

    "text": "About Safeguarding Adults Review (SAR)\nSafeguarding Adult Boards have a legal duty to coordinate Safeguarding Adult Reviews (SARs) as outlined under the Care Act 2014.\nA SAR is a multi-agency review process which seeks to determine what relevant agencies and individuals involved could have done differently that could have prevented harm or a death from taking place.\nThe purpose of a SAR is not to blame, it is to promote effective learning and improvement to prevent future deaths or serious harm occurring again.\nThe Knowsley arrangements for the consideration of Safeguarding Adult Review (SAR) referrals are through a collaboration between relevant organisations in the Local Authority areas, Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens and Wirral, called the Merseyside Safeguarding Adult Review Group (MSARG).\nKnowsley SAR referrals are directed to MSARG to consider and establish if the referral meets the criteria for a SAR. Recommendations are then made to the relevant Safeguarding Adult Board Chair about whether a SAR or other type of review should be carried out.\nCriteria for conducting a Safeguarding Adult Review\nSection 44 of the Care Act (2014) states that the Safeguarding Adult Board (SAB) must arrange a SAR when an adult with needs for care and support (even if the local authority has not been meeting any of those needs) if:\nthere is reasonable cause for concern about how the SAB, members of it or other persons with relevant functions worked together to safeguard the adult, and\nthe adult has died, and\nthe SAB knows or suspects that the death resulted from abuse or neglect (whether it knew about or suspected the abuse or neglect before the adult died)\nOr\nthe adult is still alive, and the SAB knows or suspects that the adult has experienced serious abuse or neglect\nOrganisations involved\nThe Merseyside Safeguarding Adults Review Group (MSARG) is a collaboration between organisations in the Local Authority areas of Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens and Wirral.\nWhen SARs are conducted\nA Safeguarding Adults Board (SAB) must arrange a SAR when\nAn adult with needs for care and support has died, and the SAB knows or suspects that the death resulted from abuse or neglect, whether or not it knew about or suspected the abuse or neglect before the adult died.\nAn adult is still alive, and the SAB knows or suspects that the adult has experienced serious abuse or neglect.\nThere is reasonable cause for concern about how the SAB, its members, or other persons with relevant functions worked together to safeguard the adult and one of the above conditions is met.\nHow SARs work\nOnce a SAR has been commissioned, a team of independent reviewers will be appointed to carry out the review. The reviewers will gather evidence from a range of sources, such as interviews with people involved in the case, examination of records, and visits to relevant services.\nThe reviewers will then write a report which sets out their findings and recommendations. The report will be shared with all the agencies involved in the case and with the Safeguarding Adults Board.\nThe benefits of SARs\nSARs help to improve the way that agencies work together to safeguard adults. By learning from what happened in the past, agencies can identify and address any weaknesses in their practice. This can help to prevent similar tragedies from happening again.\nLearning from SARs in Knowsley\nThe Merseyside Safeguarding Adults Board (MSAB) coordinated a voluntary Safeguarding Adults Review (SAR) for Knowsley. The review report and action plan were agreed upon by MSAB, and the newly established Knowsley Safeguarding Adults Board took on the action plan to ensure that the actions were completed and the learning was shared.\nSAR referrals\nAnyone or any agency can make a referral to The Merseyside Safeguarding Adults Review Group if they believe that the situation meets the criteria.\nPlease download the referral form below and return it to\nSAR@Wirral.gov.uk\nMore information\nVisit the Knowsley\nSafeguarding Adult Reviews website\nfor more information.\nDocument\nMr-B-case-study-July-2023.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n163.34KB\n)\nDocument\nRisk Management Processes Final.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n281.44KB\n)\nReferral form download\nDocument\nSAR Referral Form.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n170.15KB\n)",

During the assessment, we will have a conversation with you about what things you about your needs, how your caring role affects you and how we can support you to improve your wellbeing.\nWho is eligible for a carer's assessment\nAny carer who has needs for support should be offered or can request an assessment.\nAs a carer you will be entitled to an assessment regardless of the amount or type of care you provide, your financial means or your level of need for support. You can have an assessment whether or not the person you care for has had a social care needs assessment, or if they are eligible for support or not.\nIf you share caring responsibilities with another person, or more than one person, you can each have a carer's assessment. You don’t have to live with the person you are looking after or be caring full-time to have a carer's assessment. You may be juggling work and care and this is having a big impact on your life.\nHow to request a carers assessment\nYou can request a carer's assessment at any time, even if you have previously declined an assessment or the person you care for has not been assessed.\nTo request an assessment you can contact Knowsley Carers Hub on 0151 549 1412 who will offer you support as an informal carer. If Knowsley Carers Hub feels you need more support than they can offer, they will complete a referral for a carers assessment by the Council.\nYou can request an assessment before you take up your caring role.\nRespite breaks\nEligibility for respite is decided using a social care needs assessment for the cared for person.  You can request a social care needs assessment by contacting our First Response Team on 0151 443 2600.  The cared for person may be charged for any support provided, including respite, following a social care needs assessment.\nWho carries out the carer's assessment\nThe carers assessment is carried out by a suitably trained practitioner who will contact you to arrange the assessment at a time that is convenient to you.\nSupport during your assessment\nYes, you can have people with you to support you and offer their views. This could be a family member or friend, or anyone else that you trust.\nIf you think will find the carers assessment process difficult and you don’t have anyone to help you, we can arrange for someone called an advocate to attend the assessment to help you get your views across.  If you think this would be helpful you can let us know when we contact you to arrange the assessment or you can contact the advocacy hub on 0151 426 3174 and tell them you need help with a carers assessment.\nWhat happens during a carer's assessment\nDuring the assessment we will ask you questions about your strengths, interests and what you like to do.  We will ask about your caring role and how it affects you.\nIn preparation for your assessment, it is useful to give yourself some time to think about how caring affects you. It is also important to start thinking about any help that would make a difference to you as a carer. You can request a copy of the assessment questions in advance and begin to write down your thoughts to these questions.\nThe assessment is the way we decide if your needs as a carer make you eligible for support from Knowsley Council.\nTo be eligible you must meet criteria that is set out in The Care Act\nAs a result of your caring role you physical or mental health is deteriorating or is at risk of deteriorating\nAND\nYou are unable to achieve any of the below outcomes:\nCarrying out any caring responsibilities the carer has for a child\nProviding care to other persons for whom the carer provides care\nMaintaining a habitable home environment in the carer’s home (whether this is also the home of the adult needing care)\nmanaging and maintaining nutrition\nDeveloping and maintaining family or other personal relationships\nEngaging in work, training, education or volunteering\nMaking use of necessary facilities or services in the local community, including recreational facilities or services\nEngaging in recreational activities.\nWhat happens after the carer's assessment\nIf your carer’s assessment identifies that you are eligible we will make a support plan with you.\nThis will give details of the care and support to be provided to you in your caring role and what support we have agreed you need to carry on in your role.\nYour carer's assessment should include arrangements for emergency situations, for example if you become ill.\nFunding\nThere is no charge for a carer's assessment or for information and advice provided to carers.\nIf you receive services from a local voluntary organisation, these are generally provided free of charge.\nWe will meet any cost of services we agree you need as part of your support plan.  If the person you are caring for requires respite this will be part of their own support plan and there may be a charge for this.\nReviewal of your support plan\nYou can request a review of your support plan and a reassessment every 12 months.  To request a review contact Knowsley Carers Hub on 0151 549 1412.\nWhat happens if you are not eligible for support\nIf you are not eligible for care and support, we will send you a letter with our decision and a copy of the assessment.\nWe will give you advice on other services you can use and information about how to get help in future.  The Carers Hub will continue to offer you support and can refer for another assessment if your circumstances change.\nThere is a lot of support for carers in Knowsley and you can find out what is available in your area using the\nLive Well Directory\n.\nYou can also ring Healthy Knowsley to speak to one of their wellbeing coaches on 0800 0731 202.\nWhat happens if I am unhappy with the outcome?\nIf you are unhappy with the outcome, you can\nmake a complaint to the council\n, or contact us by telephone on 0151 443 3231\nYou can also contact Healthwatch Knowsley to raise a concern about the social care assessment process by\nvisiting their website\nor call 0151 449 3954.\nCarers and safeguarding\nIt is important to be aware that you, or the person you support, may be vulnerable to harm at times.

HBV can include forced marriage, FGC, and other types of violence, such as beatings, murder, and threats.\nForced marriage\nA forced marriage is a marriage that takes place without the full and free consent of both parties. This means that one or both of the people involved are being pressured or forced to marry against their will.\nFemale genital mutilation (FGM)\nFGM is any procedure that involves the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs. It is a harmful practice that can cause serious physical and psychological health problems. FGM is sometimes referred to as cutting within affected communities.\nConsent of the parents is required because the girl is a minor. When performed on an adult with consent, the procedure is usually described as clitoridectomy or may be part of labiaplasty or vaginoplasty. It does not apply to sex reassignment surgery or the genital modification of intersex individuals.\nFGM is mainly practised in North East Africa and some areas of East and South East Asia. FGM is illegal in the UK\nWhat you can do\nIf you or someone you know is being abused, there are things you can do to get help.\nIf you or someone you know is being forced to marry, you can contact the Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) at 020 7008 0151 or visit their\nwebsite\n.\nIf you feel you may be forced into marriage during a trip abroad, contact the FMU before you go.\nIf a relative or friend has not returned home from a trip abroad and you feel they may have been forced to marry, contact the FMU.\nIt may be helpful to the FMU if you can give them details such as where the person has gone, when they were due back, and when you last heard from them.\nThe FMU can provide confidential information and advice to those involved in forced marriages. They work with agencies in the UK and abroad to prevent forced marriages from taking place and to support those already in forced marriages.

Many people who enquire about becoming a Shared Lives carer often tell us that they ‘probably aren’t right’ but the truth is if you care, have a spare bedroom and time, then you are.\nThe assessment process can take up to 3-4 months to complete, and, if successful, you will then be matched with a suitable person.\nA Shared Lives Carer can support up to 3 adults at a time, providing long term support or short breaks.\nHow Shared Lives carers are paid\nShared Lives Carers are not paid by the hour, and do not work to a fixed schedule. They get paid in line with the expectations set out in agreed daily or weekly rate. This can include a payment from the service user and a Housing Benefit rent contribution.\nShared Lives carers are not employed by the council, they are self-employed. This means they have to pay their own tax and national insurance. They can get the Shared Lives tax break.\nWe will offer you training, support and guidance about how to support people in different situations, and we encourage all Shared Lives carers to attend regular training.\nOur training includes assessment and induction\nOne day induction training\nOne to one training during the assessment process\nSome of the essential training courses, which we expect all carers to attend are:\nSafeguarding\nEmergency first aid\nManual handling\nFood hygiene\nHealth and safety\nMedicines management\nOther courses are available dependent on the needs of our service users for example epilepsy or autism awareness.\nContact\nIf you'd like to become a Shared Lives carer we'd love to hear from you!\nTelephone\n0151 443 2060\nEmail\nknowsleysharedlives@knowsley.gov.uk",
