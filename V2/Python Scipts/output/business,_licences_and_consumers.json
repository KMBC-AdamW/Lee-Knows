    "text": "Introduction\nSince 2010, the council has received less money from the government. Because of this, we need to make sure we are using our land and buildings in the best way possible.\nWe need to simplify our property portfolio and sell off land and buildings that are not very useful to us. This means that we can use and invest in our remaining buildings more effectively to make sure they help us provide services to the community.\nThe council's property portfolio can be divided into two categories:\nAssets that help us provide services directly\nAssets that make money and also help the community\nIn some cases, assets may not provide enough financial or other benefits any more. In these cases, community asset transfer may be an option to bring social and other benefits to the community.\nAs a council that believes in cooperation, we believe that community asset transfer can, in some cases, give local people and organisations more control over the future of their community. This guidance recognises the potential benefits of asset transfer for the community, the organisation proposing the transfer, and the council.\nChanging ownership or management of an asset can potentially extend its use, making it more valuable to the community. It may also attract additional resources to an area and empower local residents by raising aspirations and a sense of belonging. In this way, community asset transfer can strengthen the local economy, environment, and community/voluntary sector.\nHowever, the council recognises that community asset transfer may not always be the best way forward. There may be other outcomes or priorities that are more important.\nThis guide provides a structured way to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of community asset transfer to ensure an informed decision.",

    "text": "Understanding Community Asset Transfer\nCommunity asset transfer involves transferring ownership or management of land or buildings from the council to a local community organisation. This guidance outlines the process for evaluating requests for community asset transfers and ensures fair and transparent decision-making.\nWhen Community Asset Transfer is considered\nCommunity asset transfer may be considered in two situations:\nCouncil-initiated disposal\nWhen the council decides to sell land or buildings and is willing to forgo financial gains for potential community benefits.\nCommunity-initiated request\nWhen an existing community organisation or resident within council-owned properties expresses interest in exploring asset transfer.\nThe council does not encourage speculative approaches for asset transfer.\nGuiding principles for Community Asset Transfer\nThis guidance provides a clear framework for assessing all expressions of interest in community asset transfer.\nRecognising community benefits\nThe council acknowledges the multiple advantages of community asset transfers and actively seeks to utilise asset transfer as a strategic tool.\nBalancing benefits and outcomes\nWhile the council values community benefits, it also considers other potential benefits or outcomes, such as financial returns from commercial rentals, future investment value, or regenerative benefits from asset disposal.\nBalancing asset sales and community regeneration\nThe council has existing guidelines for disposing of underused or surplus assets while investing in infrastructure projects. It strives to maintain a balance between asset sales for funding investments and regenerating communities through alternative uses.\nConsideration of risks and opportunities\nThe council's decision-making process involves weighing community benefits against the risks involved in asset transfer and the opportunity cost of alternative options.\nSupporting a stronger third sector\nThe council recognises that effective community asset ownership and management can contribute to a stronger third sector and revitalised local communities.\nAlignment with corporate goals\nThe council aims to ensure that any asset transfers align with its broader objectives outlined in the Corporate Plan and other relevant strategies.\nDecision making process\nFollowing evaluation of a proposed community asset transfer, a report with recommendations will be presented to the Executive Director of Place for a decision. This decision will be made in consultation with the Cabinet Member with Portfolio for Regeneration, Economy, and Skills.\nSchool buildings and landholding\nSchool buildings and landholding are not covered under this guidance. Any disposal of such assets would require prior approval under Section 77 of the Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998.",

    "text": "The potential benefits of Community Asset Transfer\nThe council owns a diverse range of land and buildings used for various purposes, including private, social, community, and public services. For some of these assets, transferring ownership and management to the community can bring significant benefits.\nBenefits for the local community\nResponsive management\nCommunity ownership fosters closer identification with local needs, leading to more responsive management of facilities.\nExpanded usage and activities\nIncreased use of facilities and a wider range of activities can promote health and wellbeing within the community.\nEmpowering local engagement\nCommunity asset transfer can act as a catalyst for local volunteering and active involvement in shaping and revitalising neighbourhoods, enhancing community cohesion.\nBenefits for the council and public sector\nAlignment with council objectives\nActivities supported or safeguarded through asset transfer can directly contribute to the council's objectives and the Corporate Plan.\nEstate rationalisation\nAsset transfer can contribute to the council's goal of streamlining its property portfolio and promoting more efficient asset utilisation.\nCivic engagement and volunteering\nCommunity asset transfer can foster increased levels of volunteering, civic participation, and engagement in positive activities within the borough.\nFinancial savings\nAsset transfer can lead to financial savings for the council, including reduced staff and asset overhead costs, as well as business rates.\nEncouraging external investments\nCommunity asset transfer can attract external investments into areas of need that the council may not be able to secure on its own, such as grant funding, social investment, local philanthropy, and the engagement of local employers through corporate social responsibility initiatives.\nBenefits for the community and social enterprise sector\nEnhanced capacity and recognition\nCommunity asset transfer can bring financial security, recognition, and enhanced management capacity for community and social enterprises.\nNew ventures and partnerships\nAsset transfer can foster the creation of new community businesses, social enterprises, and partnerships.\nCommunity enterprise development\nIt can build capacity within the community to take on the delivery of public services and develop as a community enterprise.\nStimulating social markets\nAsset transfer can stimulate new social markets among community and social enterprises.\nDiversifying public service providers\nIt can diversify the supply base for public services, providing more options for service delivery.\nImproved access to funding\nCommunity and social enterprises may gain improved access to funding and contract opportunities at local, regional, and national levels.\nDemonstrating benefits\nAny proposal to transfer an asset to the community will need to clearly demonstrate a range of the above outcomes and benefits.",

    "text": "National Policy Context\nThere is a strong national policy across different government parties to encourage the transfer of public land and buildings to community organisations. This is seen as a way to improve local communities by:\nEncouraging active citizenship and civil renewal\nEnhancing local public services\nReducing poverty\nPromoting economic growth\nCommunity Right to Challenge\nThe Localism Act of 2011 introduced the Community Right to Challenge, which gives community groups and voluntary organisations the right to express interest in managing council services.\nLocal authorities are also required to keep a list of assets nominated by the community as having \"community value.\" Both these initiatives are like community asset transfers. However, the Act does not automatically grant the organisation that expresses interest the right to deliver a service or manage an asset of community value, it also does not guarantee their success in any mandatory procurement process.\nOther statutory provisions\nOther laws provide community organisations and social enterprises with new ways to obtain and develop land, buildings, and privately owned assets. The Public Request to Order Disposal provisions, now known as the Right to Reclaim Land, and revisions to Compulsory Purchase guidance aim to increase community involvement in proactive regeneration efforts.\nLocal strategic context and links to other strategies\nThis guidance must align with the approach and desired outcomes of other council strategies, policies, and initiatives.\nAll transfer proposals must explicitly contribute to and impact the borough's needs as set out in the following documents:\nStrategy for Knowsley\nCorporate Plan\nMedium Term Financial Strategy\nCorporate Property Plan\nCooperative Principles\nSocial Value Model\nUnitary Development Plan\nSupplementary Planning Documents\nEconomic Regeneration Plan\nGreen Spaces Standard\nSpecific regeneration and development plans\nAny other policies relevant to a particular proposal\nThis guidance is not a standalone document, and in many cases, other outcomes and benefits may outweigh those derived from community asset transfers.",

    "text": "Putting a Community Asset Transfer into practice\nPriority for existing users\nPriority for the opportunity to have a community asset transfer will be given to the asset's existing users and community organisations.\nCompetitive process\nWhere there are several interested parties for an asset, a competitive evaluation process will be used to decide the preferred organisation, if any.\nFair and equitable\nThere is no guarantee of exclusivity on a first-come, first-served basis when considering asset transfers, and other expressions of interest will be considered as appropriate.\nCollaboration and sharing\nCollaboration between community-based organisations and the sharing of assets to optimise social value and value for money across the borough will be encouraged.\nCase-by-case management\nProposed asset transfers will be managed on a case-by-case basis within the guidance framework, and any decision to transfer an asset should not be regarded as setting a precedent.\nTransparency and information sharing\nThe council will share information regarding the condition and operating costs of the asset with the interested party.\nAs-is transfer\nIt cannot be assumed that the council will make good any minor defects with the asset before the transfer.\nFinancial responsibility\nThe community organisation will be responsible for the running costs, including repairs, maintenance, and insurances.\nNo financial support\nThe council does not give financial support for community asset transfers.\nLeasehold basis\nAny transfer for community use should be on a leasehold basis. This protects the future of these assets and ensures the council can determine any future changes in use and occupation during the lifetime of the lease.\nLease duration\nThe length of the lease should be appropriate to the business case and where appropriate, long enough to attract funders and investments.\nProtection of existing user groups\nWhere an element of wider community usage is retained after the transfer, there will be a requirement to protect existing user groups in terms of usage and charges for a limited period.\nManagement agreement\nThe social value and outcomes to be delivered, along with any other conditions or grants, will form part of a management agreement.\nCompliance monitoring\nCompliance with the management agreement will be monitored by the council as specified in the agreement.\nBelow-market value transfers\nIf a below-market value transfer is acceptable, the council will apply appropriate legal restrictions to the lease and management agreement to ensure the asset remains a community benefit and for the purposes agreed.\nConsequences of non-compliance\nFailure to comply with the management agreement can result in the management agreement ceasing and the lease will automatically terminate at the same time.\nThird-Party Control\nWhere control is passed to a third-party organisation for any purpose other than community use and benefit, this relationship will be on a commercial basis.\nAdditional notes\nWhen an agreed Asset Transfer is confirmed, new leaseholders will be required to maintain current user groups hire rates for the first 12 months. New user group hire rates can be determined by the new leaseholder.",

    "text": "Challenges and risks\nThe council recognises that there are potential challenges and risks associated with Community Asset Transfers that need to be carefully considered before making a decision to proceed. Therefore, all proposals will be evaluated against a comprehensive set of criteria to ensure that the benefits outweigh the potential drawbacks.\nKey Challenges and Risks\nLoss of capital receipt\nWhen a community organisation takes ownership of an asset, the council forfeits the potential capital gain from selling it on the open market. This could limit the council's ability to invest in other strategic initiatives.\nLoss of wider strategic benefits\nThe council may have identified specific strategic plans for the asset, such as redevelopment or future use for community purposes. A Community Asset Transfer could hinder these plans and potentially deprive the community of these benefits.\nValue for money concerns\nThe council needs to ensure that the potential benefits outweigh the costs, including any ongoing maintenance or operating expenses that will be transferred to the community organisation.\nCompliance with state aid and procurement rules\nCommunity Asset Transfer must adhere to the relevant state aid and procurement regulations to ensure fair and transparent processes.\nCapacity of community organisations\nThe council needs to assess the capacity of the proposed community organisation to effectively manage and maintain the asset, ensuring that it delivers the desired social, economic, and environmental outcomes.\nRisk of community organisation failure\nThere is a possibility that the community organisation may experience financial difficulties or cease to exist, potentially leading to the asset's deterioration or loss.\nOngoing council liabilities\nThe council may still be liable for certain obligations related to the asset, even after it has been transferred.\nFit for purpose assessment\nThe asset must be suitable for the intended use and should not impose an unreasonable burden on the community organisation or the council.\nFairness and equity\nThe council should strive to ensure that Community Asset Transfers are conducted fairly and equitably, avoiding any potential unfair advantage for one group over another.\nCommunity cohesion and reputational impact\nCommunity Asset Transfers should be carefully evaluated to minimise any potential negative impacts on community cohesion or the council's reputation in the community.",

    "text": "Creating a business case for a Community Asset Transfer\nAs many organisations applying for a community asset transfer may have limited financial history or facilities management experience, developing a robust business model supported by a solid business case is crucial. This guidance requires organisations to demonstrate their ability to manage a leased asset effectively through a business case validated by council officers.\nThe detailed requirements of this business case are outlined in Appendix A. It is the organisation's responsibility to create and present the business case, as this forms part of their overall business demonstration. The council cannot produce the business case due to a conflict of interest. However, the council can provide guidance on content, signpost external sources of business support and skills development, and offer feedback on the acceptability of the plan.\nAppendix A: Expected contents of a business case for a Community Asset Transfer\nThe foundation of a successful transfer lies in the organisation demonstrating to the council a proposal with a clear business model rationale supported by a robust business plan showcasing their ability to effectively manage the asset, including the financial and organisational capacity of the applicant.\nCommunity Asset Transfer Proposal and Business Model\nOrganisation details\nWho you are and how long you have existed.\nCurrent involvement in the community.\nLegal structure, governance, and how local people are involved.\nTrack record and contact details.\nIdentified building/land\nSpecify the building or land proposed for transfer.\nLease Duration\nIndicate the requested lease length.\nFinancial support\nOutline any funding the organisation will bring to support the transfer, including refurbishment/remodelling and development grants or loans.\nProposal's needs and benefits\nExplain how the proposal meets the needs of the organisation's users, the wider community, and the council.\nDescribe the intended use of the building, including planned activities and availability.\nLocal support\nDemonstrate local support for the proposal through consultation and show that it is not solely aligned with a single interest group.\nAsset operational timescales\nProvide indicative timescales for when the asset will be operational.\nDetailed business plan\nThe business plan is the most crucial document in informing the decision about whether to proceed with a community asset transfer.\nAll business plans should address the following\nExpected outcomes and delivery program\nOutline the expected outcomes and the proposed program for delivering them.\nProposed impact and benefits\nDescribe the proposed impact and the social, economic, and environmental benefits for the local community.\nAsset management and operations\nExplain the arrangements for managing and operating the asset on a daily basis, including staff, volunteers, necessary expertise, and any training, capacity, or skills building requirements within the organisation.\nLegal compliance\nAddress compliance with relevant legislation and regulatory controls, including equality standards, safeguarding, health & safety, disability discrimination, and licensing requirements.\nTrack record and strengths\nHighlight the organisation's track record of delivering services and/or managing property.\nConduct a SWOT analysis to identify the organisation's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\nMarket needs and demand\nAssess the local needs that the activities will be responding to and the beneficiaries.\nAnalyse demand from users for the asset.\nProjected utilisation and competition\nProvide projected utilisation rates and activity timetables.\nEvaluate the supply of similar activities in the same area and determine the response strategy, whether collaboration or competition.\nPricing and charging guidance\nEstablish pricing and charging guidance for users (individuals and groups) to maximise opportunities for income generation and ensure sustainability.\nMarketing and asset investment\nDevelop a marketing plan to promote the asset to potential users, identifying methods and targeted groups.\nOutline plans for investing in and maintaining the asset, including how all health and safety responsibilities will be met.\nIdentify any sources of finance that the asset transfer will release or attract.\nFinancial projections\nProvide financial projections, including a three to five year budgeted profit and loss, a first year cashflow forecast, and any capital expenditure required to develop the asset, demonstrating the longer term financial sustainability of the proposal.\nExplain the assumptions in the financial plan and provide supporting evidence for any funding arrangements, such as grants or loans.\nRisk assessment\nConduct a risk assessment to identify potential risks and outline strategies to prevent or mitigate them.",

    "text": "What is animal licencing\nAnimal licencing is a system that requires people to obtain a licence from their local council before they can keep certain types of animals. This includes wild, dangerous, or exotic animals, as well as certain types of domestic animals, such as dogs and cats.\nWhy animal licencing is important\nThere are a number of reasons why animal licencing is important.\nFirst, it helps to ensure that animals are kept in safe and humane conditions. As a local council we have a duty to inspect licenced premises and to ensure that animals are being properly cared for. If we find that an animal is not being kept in a suitable environment, we can take steps to protect the animal, such as requiring the owner to make improvements or even removing the animal from their care.\nSecond, animal licencing helps to prevent the spread of disease. Licenced premises are required to maintain high standards of hygiene and to ensure that their animals are vaccinated against common diseases. This helps to protect both public health and animal health.\nThird, animal licencing helps to reduce the number of unwanted animals. When people have to pay for a licence to keep an animal, they are more likely to think carefully about whether they are prepared to make a long-term commitment to the animal. This can help to reduce the number of animals that end up in shelters or on the streets.\nAnimal activities that require an animal licence\nHere is a list of animal activities that require an animal licence in the UK:\nSelling animals as pets\nProviding or arranging provision of boarding for cats or dogs\nHiring out horses\nDog breeding\nKeeping or training animals for exhibition\nIf you are unsure whether you need an animal licence for a particular activity, you should contact us.\nThis list is not exhaustive and there may be other activities that require an animal licence depending on the specific circumstances.\nEnvironmental Health - Who to contact\nWho to contact\nEnvironmental Health\nSend us a message\n0151 443 4712",

Park homes are subject to licensing by the local council, which ensures that the safety and welfare of residents is safeguarded.\nThe council can use the licensing process to set standards for the park and its facilities, such as the condition of the roads, the provision of services, and the safety of the homes. The council can also require the park owner to make any necessary alterations to the park or its facilities, subject to prior approval.\nIn addition to licensing, some developments on park home sites may also require planning permission from the local council.

We also regulate gaming and gaming machines on alcohol-licensed premises.\nIn addition, we grant permits to family entertainment centres to use certain lower-stake gaming machines and grant permits for prize gaming. We also look at occasional use notices for betting at tracks.\nFinally, we register small societies' lotteries.\nThe Gambling Act 2005 states that (except in the case of tracks) only people who hold or have applied for an operating licence from the Gambling Commission may apply to the council's licensing authority for a premises licence.\nKnowsley Council Gambling Policy\nKnowsley Council has approved a new gambling policy for 2025-27, which came into effect on 1 January 2025.\nThe policy outlines the council's approach to licensing gambling premises and promoting responsible gambling. It is designed to protect children and vulnerable people from the harmful effects of gambling and to prevent gambling from being associated with crime or disorder.\nThe Gambling Commission’s website\nalso provides a wealth of further information about the Gambling Act legislative provisions.\nDocument\nKnowsley Gambling Policy 2025 - 2027.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n925.03KB\n)\nHow to apply\nFor further information about gambling-related licences and how to apply, contact the Licensing Section by calling 0151 443 2300 or emailing\nlicensing@knowsley.gov.uk",

    "text": "Approved lists of suppliers\nThe Council does not maintain an approved list of suppliers. All potential suppliers are those who register an interest on the Chest, which allows the councils to advertise their tender opportunities to the widest possible audience of interested suppliers. It is up to you, as a supplier, to ensure that your company profile on\nthe Chest\nreflects the type of contract that you would be interested in tendering for.\nThere are some opportunities to join Dynamic Purchasing Systems, the modern equivalent of 'approved lists of suppliers', but these are open and transparent. These opportunities are primarily in the field of health and social care.\nFinding tenders\nYou can find out when contracts are being tendered by the Council by registering on\nthe Chest\n. Registration is simple and free, and you can browse opportunities for other Contracting Authorities across NW England and further afield.\nProviding information\nYou will need to provide information when you submit a tender or register an interest in an advertised opportunity. This information is required by law and will be used to assess your bid. The Council will only ever ask for the information that is needed.\nWinning council work\nThe Council aims to make contracts accessible to Small/Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs), the Voluntary & Community Sector (VCSEs), and local businesses of any size. The Council guarantees a fair tender process, with each application treated equally and transparently.\nProcurement process\nThe procurement process can take some time due to legal requirements set by the\nPublic Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCRs 2015)\nand the need to ensure that all bids are assessed fairly. The Council will try to keep bidders fully informed and will publish the individual procurement timescale in its tender documentation.\nBenefits of working with the Council\nThe Council guarantees a fair tender process, with each application treated equally and transparently. The Council has a prompt invoice payment policy and is a reliable customer. Working with public sector buyers also provides a track record to help you win work with other organisations, and where appropriate, the Council will provide references for you to use.\nTender pricing\nIn the majority of cases, your submitted price will be your final price. You should tender your best price and ensure it is sustainable for you and for the Council.\nElectronic tendering\nTendering is carried out through the Council's eProcurement portal for several reasons. An electronic process creates efficiencies for the Council and for bidders; it ensures that the tender process is fully auditable and the\nPublic Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCRs 2015)\n(and as amended) prescribe compulsory electronic tendering. Additionally, there are both cost and environmental benefits to electronic, rather than paper-based procurement.\nHelp with tendering\nThe Council cannot tender on your behalf, but it is always on hand to support bidders with the process within the constraints of equal treatment. Always read and follow the instructions for tendering and ask for feedback where you have not been successful. Wherever possible, the Council holds meet the buyer and training events to assist suppliers, or can point you in the direction of existing training and guidance provided by others.\nMeeting with the Council\nIn order to maintain equal treatment of all its suppliers, the Council does not meet with potential suppliers. However, the Procurement Team organises Meet the Buyer events on a regular basis and undertakes market engagement exercises for contracts that are complex or where requirements need the input of suppliers. These are notified to the market through advertisement on the Chest in the same way that tenders are advertised.\nSubmitting an interest in tendering\nWhen you have registered as a supplier on the Chest, you are able to formally register an interest in tendering for a specific opportunity when you see it advertised. Don't worry if you subsequently do not submit a tender, even if you have registered an interest, as this will not count against you when future opportunities are advertised. It may be, for instance, that you access the tender documentation after registering an interest and then decide that the opportunity does not match your business offer.\nChoosing a supplier\nFor individual one-off spends under £5,000: The Council is able to obtain the required goods or services by means of obtaining only one quotation. Such low value requirements are unlikely to be advertised on\nthe Chest\nand will not necessarily be notified to the Procurement Team.\nFor individual requirements between £5,000 and £24,999: the Council may use pre-existing framework agreements, search websites and catalogues, or undertake a Request for Quotation exercise which may or may not be advertised on\nthe Chest\nas an open opportunity.\nRequirements between £25,000 and the relevant\nWorld Trade Organisation Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) threshold\n: The Procurement Team leads the procurement activity. This means dependent upon risks identified and local market conditions, some competitions will be closed to identified local suppliers, whilst others will be openly advertised. Adverts are placed on\nthe Chest\nand\nContracts Finder\n.\nSuppliers interested in providing goods and services should make contact with individual Services within the Council.\nRequirements in excess of the GPA thresholds: The Procurement Team leads the activity, and advertises the opportunity on\nthe Chest\n,\nContracts Finder\n, and\nFind a Tender Service (FTS)\n.\nNote:\nAdverts published before the 31st December 2020 can be found in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union (OJEU)\nnot FTS.",

This can include supporting the environment, creating jobs, and improving the lives of residents.\nThe Council is committed to including Social Value in its contracts.

We will support improvements and maintaining of our public spaces and parks along with using sustainable products and materials.\nSocial Value can be either a mandatory part of the contract specification or an additional initiative proposed and implemented by the supplier. The Council appreciates both approaches.\nWhy considering social value is important\nSocial Value is not just a nice thing to do; it's a critical part of our corporate mission and a way to optimise our use of public funds. As financial constraints increase and demand for services expands, it's more important than ever to think creatively about how we spend our money.\nWe must constantly ask ourselves:\nWhat matters most to our local communities?\nHow can we deliver services in ways that positively impact the community and the environment?\nHow can we support local businesses?\nHow can we collaborate more effectively to engage hard-to-reach individuals?\nHow can we address current local challenges through community partnerships?\nThe Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012\nmandates that public bodies in England consider the inclusion of Social Value when procuring goods, services, and works subject to the Public Contracts Regulations 2015. This legislation doesn't alter the procurement process itself. Instead, it emphasises the public sector's responsibility to assess the broader impact (social, economic, and environmental) of its procurement decisions.\nWhat the Council is doing\nTake a look at what we are doing to\ndrive Social Value from Council contracts\n.\nTake a look further into our framework and guidance on social value:\nDocument\nSocial-Value-Procurement-Framework-2022-2026.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n65.51KB\n)\nDocument\nSocial-Value-Guidance.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n45.23KB\n)",

    "text": "Pre-Tender\nGet involved\nConsider influencing the buying organisation's Social Value policy and strategy by participating in policy discussions, strategic meetings, and market engagement activities.\nKnow the organisation\nFamiliarise yourself with the buying organisation's procurement strategy and any Social Value materials they have published. Understand their corporate priorities to align your approach.\nDuring the Tender\nRead thoroughly\nBefore crafting your bid, thoroughly review the buying organisation's procurement strategy and any other relevant information on their approach to Social Value.\nInvestigate priorities\nExplore the buying organisation's Corporate Priorities and the \"menu\" of ideas provided by the TOMs (Teams of Market Experts). Consider your past achievements in delivering Social Value commitments.\nCost-effectiveness\nUnderstand that solutions outside the core requirements should be delivered at no additional cost to the buying organisation. The costs of these additional elements should be borne by you.\nClarify doubts\nRead the tender documents carefully, including any guidance provided on responding to the Social Value element. If you have any questions, seek clarification during the designated clarification period. Raise Social Value concerns if not addressed adequately.\nPartnership with supply chain\nCollaborate with your supply chain or consortium members to identify and deliver Social Value commitments. Consider options that benefit both your business and the buying organisation, such as health and wellbeing support for staff.\nWriting the Bid\nAnswer accurately\nRespond directly to the specific questions posed, not questions you think should have been asked. Social Value may be both a core requirement and an opportunity to explore additional solutions. Clearly outline your approach to both.\nSpecificity is key\nAvoid generic responses. Tailor your answers to the buying organisation's specific needs and desires.\nDefinitive commitments\nAs a general rule, particularly when the tender falls under the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, ensure your response is definitive about the specific actions you will take.\nAvoid mere policies\nDon't just talk about existing policies or ongoing activities. Focus on concrete initiatives you will undertake if awarded the contract.\nStart, maintain, and expand\nOutline specific actions you will initiate upon contract award (new jobs, volunteering), maintain if retaining or winning the contract (retaining jobs, continued volunteering), and expand upon if securing the contract (volunteering in the buying organisation's area, setting up community groups).\nInnovation encouraged\nWhile staying relevant to the tender, embrace innovation and originality in your proposed Social Value commitments.\nPost-Tender\nContractual obligations\nIf successful, you will likely be contractually bound to fulfil your Social Value commitments. Ensure your proposals are realistic and achievable.\nReporting and progress\nAgree with the buying organisation on how and when you will report on your progress in delivering Social Value commitments throughout the contract.\nFeedback and improvement\nIf unsuccessful, seek feedback from the buying organisation, particularly regarding your Social Value approach. Use this feedback to strengthen your offer and approach for future opportunities.\nAdditional information for bidders\nSocial Value in quotations\nNot all tender opportunities include Social Value requirements. If Social Value is not mentioned in a tender document, you can inquire during the tender period to confirm whether it has been considered and disregarded.\nEqual treatment for suppliers\nThe Council ensures that all suppliers are treated equally by providing all bidders with the same comprehensive information to support their submissions.\nSocial Value for non-local suppliers\nBeing a non-local supplier does not preclude you from winning contracts. However, offering Social Value within the Council's locality can strengthen your bid.\nEvaluation criteria\nPrice is not the sole determinant in evaluating bids. Evaluation criteria are based on proportionality and relevance to the procurement in terms of Price, Quality, and Social Value.\nMarket engagement for bidders\nThe Council collaborates closely with service commissioners to identify and understand relevant and proportionate social, economic, and environmental opportunities for each contract. When appropriate, we engage with the market to provide feedback opportunities before issuing the tender.",

This may involve amending specifications to include Social Value requirements as a core part of the contract, or simply encouraging suppliers to consider ways to deliver Social Value as part of their bids.\nConsulting with the market\nWe also consult with the relevant market to ensure that the Social Value requirements we are setting are achievable and proportionate to the contract. This may involve public consultation with users or residents to understand their priorities, or market engagement with suppliers to identify innovative ways to deliver Social Value.\nOur approach to social value\nOur approach to Social Value is to strike a balance between setting clear expectations and allowing for innovation and flexibility. We want to ensure that Social Value is a meaningful part of the procurement process, but we also want to give suppliers the freedom to develop creative and effective solutions.\nBy incorporating Social Value into our procurement process, we can ensure that our contracts not only deliver the goods and services we need, but also make a positive difference to the lives of people in our local communities.",

    "text": "Business rates, also known as non-domestic rates, are a way for businesses to contribute to the funding of local services. Although the council collects business rates, the amount payable is determined by the government.\nKnowsley Council is committed to safeguarding public funds and may use the information you provide or have access to for fraud prevention and detection purposes.\nAdditionally, the council may share this information with other organizations for these purposes, as well as for tax and charge administration and collection, and to fulfil other statutory enforcement responsibilities.\nFurther information about business rates can be found on the\nGovernment Information Website\n.\nCalculating business rates\nYour business rates bill is calculated by multiplying the rateable value of your property by the appropriate multiplier.\nThe rateable value is determined by the Valuation Office Agency, and the multiplier is set by the government.\nThe standard rating multiplier for 2023-24 is 51.2 pence, and the small business rates relief multiplier is 49.9 pence.\nTransitional arrangements may also be applied, and any applicable mandatory or discretionary reliefs are deducted.\nPayment options\nYou are not required to pay your entire business rates bill at once. You have the option to pay in ten- or twelve-monthly instalments starting in April. Failure to make timely payments will result in the cancellation of your instalment plan.\nPayment methods\nDirect Debit is the most convenient way to pay your business rates bill. We also offer a variety of alternative payment methods. For details on these options, please refer to our information on how to pay your business rates.\nAppeal your rateable value\nThe Valuation Office Agency (VOA) calculate rateable values. If you think the current value for your property is wrong you can:\nAppeal to the VOA and ask them to correct the details you think are wrong.\nContact\nWebsite\nhttp://www.voa.gov.uk/\nEmail\nratingnorthwest@voa.gsi.gov.uk\nTelephone\n03000 501 501\nAddress\nNon-Domestic Rates North West\nRedgrave Court\nMerton Road\nBootle\nMerseyside\nL20 7HS\nAppeal your rates\nif you and the VOA can’t agree through the Valuations Tribunal.\nAppeals\nYou are still obligated to pay your business rates while your appeal is pending. If you fail to do so, we will initiate recovery action, which may include the issuance of a summons and the imposition of additional costs.\nIf your appeal is successful, you will be refunded any overpaid business rates upon request. You will also be eligible for interest payments, provided you have made instalment payments in accordance with your bill, and we have not obtained a Liability Order.\nTransitional relief\nThe rateable value of non-domestic properties is typically reassessed every three years. If your property's rateable value increases significantly as a result of a revaluation, your rates will increase gradually. Transitional relief is a mechanism that limits the extent to which your rates can increase following a revaluation. We automatically calculate this relief and adjust your bill accordingly. The reduction for transitional relief will be displayed on your non-domestic rate bill if applicable.\nFuture revaluations\nThe most recent revaluation took effect on April 1, 2023, and the next revaluation is scheduled for 2026.\nEmpty property rates\nIf you own or rent a business property that is unoccupied, you are not required to pay business rates for the first three months. After this period, most businesses must pay full empty property rates. Industrial premises are exempt from business rates for the first six months after becoming empty.\nExemptions\nCertain properties are eligible for extended empty property relief:\nListed buildings that are unoccupied\nBuildings with a rateable value below £2,900 that are unoccupied\nProperties owned by charities if their next use will be for charitable purposes\nCommunity amateur sports club buildings if their next use will be as a sports club\nProperties where the owner is prohibited by law, by action taken by the Crown or a public authority, from occupying or allowing occupation\nPartial occupancy\nRatepayers are responsible for paying full business rates regardless of whether a property is fully or partially occupied. In certain circumstances, if a portion of a property is vacant for a brief period, we may be able to grant relief for the unoccupied portion.\nRelief for charities and similar organisations\nRelief may be granted to charities or similar organisations that occupy premises and use them wholly or primarily for charitable purposes. We may require additional information if you request this relief. This type of relief, known as mandatory relief, can reduce your business rates by up to 80%.\nDiscretionary rate relief\nIn certain circumstances, we may also grant relief towards all or part of the rates bill of organisations that occupy premises and are not established or conducted for profit. This is known as Discretionary Rate Relief, and each council has its own eligibility criteria. To apply for this relief, you must contact us and complete a form. We will also request information to confirm your eligibility.\nContact\nBusiness Rates Team\nTelephone\n0151 443 4126/4069\nEmail\nbusiness.rates@knowsley.gov.uk",

    "text": "About assets of community value\nThe Localism Act 2011 introduced a new concept called \"Assets of Community Value\" (ACVs). These are buildings or pieces of land that are important to a local community and are protected from being sold off without the community having a chance to bid for them.\nHow to identify an ACV\nAn asset of community value is a building or piece of land that:\nIs currently used, or has been used in the recent past, to benefit the local community in some way, such as by providing social, cultural, or recreational activities.\nCould continue to be used in this way in the future.\nWho can nominate an ACV\nGroups such as parish councils, local voluntary organisations, and community groups can nominate local land or buildings to be included in the list of ACVs maintained by local authorities.\nWhat happens when an ACV is sold\nThe owner of an ACV must notify the local authority when they intend to sell it. This triggers a moratorium period, which gives the local community time to prepare a bid for the property.\nIf no bidder comes forward during the moratorium period, the owner can sell the property to whomever they choose. However, if a community group expresses an interest in buying the property, the owner must give them a fair opportunity to bid.\nTypes of properties that are excluded from ACV status\nCertain types of properties are not eligible for ACV status, including:\nLand attached to residential property\nSites covered by the Caravan Sites Act\nLand used by public utilities\nHow long an ACV can stay on the list\nA property remains on the list of ACVs for five years. After this time, it can be removed from the list if the owner wishes to sell it.\nBenefits of ACVs\nAssets of community value can provide a number of benefits to local communities, including:\nProtecting important community assets from being lost to development\nProviding opportunities for local communities to take ownership of their own assets\nPromoting social cohesion and community spirit\nDownloads\nDocument\n1.

    "text": "Understanding purchase orders and invoicing for Knowsley Council\nAs a supplier to Knowsley Council, it's essential to understand our invoicing and payment procedures. Here's a simplified guide to ensure your invoices are processed promptly and you receive timely payments.\nNo purchase order, no payment\nKnowsley Council adheres to a strict \"no purchase order, no payment\" policy. This means that you must obtain a valid purchase order number before providing any goods or services to the council. Verbal or written instructions from council staff without a purchase order number are not valid.\nIf you submit an invoice without a valid purchase order number, you will receive an email notification. Future invoices without purchase order numbers will not be processed for payment.\nObtaining purchase order numbers\nCouncil staff are responsible for issuing formal purchase order numbers for the supply of goods and services. When placing an order, always request a purchase order number from your council contact.\nOur financial system generates purchase order numbers in the format '40XXXXXX,' such as 40123456. Ensure that all purchase orders you receive adhere to this format.\nIf a Knowsley Council buyer requests goods or services without providing a purchase order number, kindly refer them to this policy. Do not proceed with the order until a valid purchase order number is provided.\nInvoice requirements\nTo ensure smooth invoice processing and timely payment, please adhere to the following invoice requirements:\nCompany details\nClearly include your company name and address on the invoice.\nVAT registration number (if applicable)\nIf registered for VAT, provide your VAT registration number on the invoice.\nInvoice number and date\nAssign a unique invoice number and include the invoice date.\nValid purchase order number\nProminently display the valid purchase order number provided by the council.\nService area or Council contact\nIdentify the service area requesting the goods or services or provide the name of the council contact person.\nDetailed description of goods or services\nProvide a clear and detailed description of the goods or services supplied.\nLine item breakdown\nFor each line item, include the quantity, description, unit price, net value, VAT rate, VAT value, and line total.\nInvoice totals\nCalculate and display the invoice totals for Net, VAT, and Gross amounts.\nElectronic invoice submission\nTo ensure timely invoice processing and payment, send all invoices electronically to the email address specified on your purchase order.

    "text": "Non-Domestic Rates\nNon-Domestic Rates, or business rates, collected by local authorities are the way that those who occupy non-domestic property contribute towards the cost of local services. Under the business rates retention arrangements introduced from 1st April 2013, authorities keep a proportion of the business rates paid locally. The money, together with revenue from council taxpayers, locally generated income and grants from central government, is used to pay for the services provided by local authorities in your area.\nFurther information about the non-domestic rates system can be found on the Government's website\nas well as here on the Knowsley Council website. Alternatively, you can contact us directly.\nApart from properties that are exempt from business rates, each non-domestic property has a rateable value which is set by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), an agency of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. They compile and maintain\na full list of all rateable values\n. The rateable value of your property is shown on the front of your bill. This broadly represents the yearly rent the property could have been let for on the open market on a particular date specified in legislation. For the current rating list, this date was set as 1st April 2021.\nThe VOA may alter the valuation if circumstances change. The ratepayer (and certain others who have an interest in the property) can also check and challenge the valuation shown in the list if they believe it is wrong. Further information about the grounds on which challenges may be made and the process for doing so can be obtained by contacting the VOA, or\nby consulting the VOA website\n.\nNon-Domestic Rates Instalments\nPayment of non-domestic rate bills is automatically set on a 10-monthly cycle. However, the Government has put in place regulations that allow businesses to require their local authority to enable payments to be made through 12 monthly instalments. If you wish to take up this offer, you should contact Knowsley Council as soon as possible.\nNational Non-Domestic Rating Multiplier\nKnowsley Council calculates the non-domestic rate bill for a property by multiplying the rateable value of the property by the appropriate non-domestic multiplier. There are two multipliers: the standard non-domestic rating multiplier and the small business non-domestic rating multiplier. The Government sets the multipliers for each financial year, except in the City of London where special arrangements apply.\nRatepayers who occupy a property with a rateable value which does not exceed £50,999 will have their bills calculated using the lower small business non-domestic rating multiplier, rather than the standard non-domestic rating multiplier. Both multipliers for a financial year are based on the previous year's multiplier adjusted to reflect the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation figure for the September prior to the billing year, unless a lower multiplier is set by the Government. The current multipliers are shown on the front of your demand notice (bill).\nRateable Value\nApart from properties that are exempt from business rates, each non-domestic property has a rateable value which is set by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), an agency of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. They compile and maintain a full list of all rateable values, available at\nwww.gov.uk/voa\n. The rateable value of your property is shown on the front of your bill. This broadly represents the yearly rent the property could have been let for on the open market on a particular date specified in legislation. For the current rating list, this date was set as 1st April 2021.\nThe VOA may alter the valuation if circumstances change. The ratepayer (and certain others who have an interest in the property) can also check and challenge the valuation shown in the list if they believe it is wrong. Further information about the grounds on which challenges may be made and the process for doing so can be obtained by contacting the VOA, or by consulting the VOA website at:\nwww.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-check-your-rateable-value-is-correct\n.\nRevaluations\nAll non-domestic property rateable values are reassessed at revaluations. The most recent revaluation took effect from 1st April 2023. Revaluations ensure that non-domestic rate bills are up-to-date and more accurately reflect current rental values and relative changes in rents. Frequent revaluations ensure the system continues to be responsive to changing economic conditions.\nNon-Domestic Rate Reliefs\nDepending on individual circumstances, a ratepayer may be eligible for a rate relief (i.e. a reduction in their business rates bill). There are a range of available reliefs. Further details are provided below and\non the Government website\n, or by contacting your Knowsley Council.\nTemporary Reliefs\nSome of the permanent reliefs are set out below but other temporary reliefs may be introduced by the Government at a fiscal event. Further detail on current temporary reliefs is available at:\nwww.gov.uk/apply-for-business-rate-relief\n. You should contact Knowsley Council for details on the latest availability of non-domestic rate reliefs and advice on whether you may qualify.\nSmall Business Rates Relief\nIf a ratepayer's sole or main property has a rateable value which does not exceed a set threshold, the ratepayer may receive a percentage reduction in their rate bill for the property of up to a maximum of 100%. The level of reduction will depend on the rateable value of the property. For example, eligible properties with a rateable value below a specified lower threshold will receive 100% relief while eligible properties above the lower threshold and below a specified upper threshold may receive partial relief. The relevant thresholds for relief are set by the Government by order and can be obtained from Knowsley Council or\non the Government's website\n. Generally, these percentage reductions (reliefs) are only available to ratepayers who occupy either-\n(a) one property, or\n(b) one main property and other additional properties providing those additional properties each have a rateable value which does not exceed the limit set by order.\nThe aggregate rateable value of all the properties mentioned in (b), must also not exceed an amount set by order. For those businesses that take on an additional property which would normally have meant the loss of small business rate relief, they will be allowed to keep that relief for a fixed additional period. Full details on the relevant limits in relation to second properties and the current period for which a ratepayer may continue to receive relief after taking on an additional property can be obtained from Knowsley Council or\non the Government's website\n.\nCertain changes in circumstances will need to be notified to Knowsley Council by the ratepayer who is in receipt of relief (other changes will be picked up by the Council). The changes which should be notified are-\n(a) the property falling vacant,\n(b) the ratepayer taking up occupation of an additional property, or\n(c) an increase in the rateable value of a property occupied by the ratepayer in an area other than the area of the local authority which granted the relief.\nCharity and Community Amateur Sports Club Relief\nCharities and registered Community Amateur Sports Clubs are entitled to 80% relief where the property is occupied by the charity or the club and is wholly or mainly used for the charitable purposes of the charity (or of that and other charities), or for the purposes of the club (or of that and other clubs).\nKnowsley Council has discretion to give further relief on the remaining bill. Full details can be obtained from Knowsley Council.\nTransitional Rate Relief\nAt a revaluation, some ratepayers will see reductions or no change in their bill whereas some ratepayers will see increases. Transitional relief schemes are introduced at each revaluation to help those facing increases. Transitional relief is applied automatically to bills. Further information about transitional arrangements may be obtained from the local authority or\non the Government's website\n.\nLocal Discounts and Hardship Relief\nLocal authorities have a general power to grant discretionary local discounts and to give hardship relief in specific circumstances. Full details can be obtained from Knowsley Council.\nUnoccupied Property Rating\nNon-Domestic Rates are generally payable in respect of unoccupied non-domestic property. However, they are generally not payable for the first three months that a property is empty. This is extended to six months in the case of certain industrial premises, whilst certain other properties such as vacant listed buildings are not liable for business rates until they are reoccupied. Full details on exemptions can be obtained from Knowsley Council or\non the Government's website\n.\nSubsidy Control\nThe new UK subsidy control regime commenced from 4 January 2023. The new regime enables public authorities, including devolved administrations and local authorities, to deliver subsidies that are tailored for local needs. Public authorities giving subsidies must comply with the UK’s international subsidy control commitments. The subsidy control legislation provides the framework for a new, UK-wide subsidy control regime.\nRead more information about subsidy control\n.\nRating Advisers\nRatepayers do not have to be represented in discussions about the rateable value of their property or their rates bill. However, ratepayers who do wish to be represented should be aware that members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS website:\nwww.rics.org\n) and the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation (IRRV website:\nwww.irrv.org.uk\n) are qualified and are regulated by rules of professional conduct designed to protect the public from misconduct.\nBefore you employ a rating adviser or company you should check that they have the necessary knowledge and expertise, as well as appropriate indemnity insurance. Take great care and, if necessary, seek further advice before entering into any contract.\nInformation Supplied with Demand Notices\nInformation relating to the relevant and previous financial years in regard to the gross expenditure of Knowsley Council is available at:\nwww.knowsley.gov.uk\n.

Alternatively, you can contact us directly.Apart from properties that are exempt from business rates, each non-domestic property has a rateable value which is set by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), an agency of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. They compile and maintaina full list of all rateable values. The rateable value of your property is shown on the front of your bill. This broadly represents the yearly rent the property could have been let for on the open market on a particular date specified in legislation. For the current rating list, this date was set as 1st April 2021.The VOA may alter the valuation if circumstances change. The ratepayer (and certain others who have an interest in the property) can also check and challenge the valuation shown in the list if they believe it is wrong. Further information about the grounds on which challenges may be made and the process for doing so can be obtained by contacting the VOA, orby consulting the VOA website."

For example, eligible properties with a rateable value below a specified lower threshold will receive 100% relief while eligible properties above the lower threshold and below a specified upper threshold may receive partial relief.
