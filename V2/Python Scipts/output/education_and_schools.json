This guide will help you when applying for in-year admission to Knowsley schools.\nYou may want an in-year admission to a Knowsley school because:\nYou are moving your address into the area, and your child cannot continue attending school due to travel distance/time.\nYour child is currently in an independent (private) school, or you have elected to home-educate, but you now want your child to attend a Knowsley school.\nOther reasons why you no longer want your child to continue to attend their current school.\nPlease note:\nThere is no guarantee that a place will be available in your school/s of preference or that siblings will be offered places in the same school.\nIf your child has an Education Health and Care Plan (EHCP), you should contact your local authority's Special Education Needs Service about changing schools, as different procedures apply.\nYou should receive an outcome to your application within 15 school days. In-year applications are not processed during school holiday periods when schools are closed. Please remember this when applying or making enquiries about an outcome.\nTo apply for a school outside Knowsley, you will need to follow the in-year admission procedures of that local authority.",

    "text": "Overview\nIf your child has been refused a place at a school this is because there is no place available and the admission authority of the school believe that, to admit another child, would impact on education – this is known as creating prejudice to the provision of efficient education and the efficient use of resources in the school.\nApplicants have a right to appeal against the refusal of a school place. For example, if they feel that there are reasons why their child should be offered a place in a particular school that have not previously been considered, or, if they feel the admission authority of the school has not correctly applied their admission arrangements and their child has been disadvantaged in securing a place because of this.\nThe appeal panel can either turn down the appeal, or they can decide that the school admission authority should make an exceptional place available.\nThe panel of people (usually three) who make the decision are independent and have no direct involvement with the school. The appeal is supported by a neutral Clerk who makes sure the appeal hearing is conducted correctly and who can provide guidance about national admission appeal legislation. The clerk confirms the outcome of the appeal to parents after the hearing has finished.",

You can usually do this by calling or emailing the school office.\nAsk for permission in advance for planned absences\nIf you need to take your child out of school for a special occasion, such as a wedding or holiday, be sure to ask the school for permission well in advance.\nTake an interest in your child's school work\nTalk to your child about their day at school, and help them with their homework assignments. This shows your child that you value their education and are there to support them.\nIf you have any concerns about your child's school attendance, please talk to their teacher or welfare team.

It’s a great way to contribute to your local community, make a difference and improve the life chances of all children to ensure they have the very best educational opportunities.\nWhat will I be expected to do as a local authority governor\nSchool governors provide strategic leadership and accountability in schools. Governors appoint the headteacher and deputy headteacher.  It is governors who hold the main responsibility for finance in schools, and it is governors who work with the headteacher to make the tough decisions about balancing resources.\nEach individual governor is a member of a governing board, which is established in law as a corporate body. Individual governors may not act independently of the rest of the governing board. Decisions are the joint responsibility of the governing board.\nThe role of the governing board is a strategic one, it has three core responsibilities\nEnsuring clarity of vision, ethos and strategic direction.\nHolding the headteacher to account for the educational performance of the school and its pupils; and\nOverseeing the financial performance of the school and making sure its money is well spent.\nIn order to achieve these responsibilities, the Governing Board works with the school on planning and developing polices and keeping the school under review. Its powers and responsibilities must be exercised in partnership with the Headteacher and staff.\nEffective governance is based on six key features\nStrategic leadership that sets and champions vision, ethos and strategy.\nAccountability that drives up educational standards and financial performance.\nPeople with the right skills, experience, qualities and capacity.\nStructures that reinforce clearly defined roles and responsibilities.\nCompliance with statutory and contractual requirements.\nEvaluation to monitor and improve the quality and impact of governance.\nThe headteacher is responsible for the internal organisation, management and control of the school and the implementation of the strategic framework established by the governing body.\nThere are different types of school governors that sit on a governing board.",

If you want your child to be considered under these criteria, you will need to complete a supplementary information form (SIF).\nThe common application form (CAF) does not always gather all the information that individual schools need to apply their oversubscription criteria. Therefore, some schools request that applicants complete an SIF.\nSIFs typically ask for additional information about your child's circumstances, such as their religious beliefs or attendance at siblings' schools. This information helps the school to assess your child's application fairly and accurately.\nKnowsley Catholic and Church of England schools typically have an SIF that applicants must complete if they want their application to be considered under certain faith criteria. You can get these forms directly from the schools or download them from the Knowsley Council website.\nIf you are applying to a school that has an SIF, it is important to read the form carefully and complete it fully and accurately. You should also submit the SIF to the school by the deadline.\nIf you have any questions about SIFs, please contact the schools you are interested in applying to.\nHere are some additional tips for completing SIFs:\nBe honest and accurate in your responses.\nProvide any supporting documentation that is requested, such as a copy of your child's baptismal certificate or a letter from a religious leader.\nIf you are unsure about how to complete a question, contact the school for assistance.\nBy completing SIFs accurately and on time, you can help to ensure that your child's application is given full consideration.\nSupplementary Information Forms\nAttachment\nDocument\nSecondary-Catholic-SIF-2024-25.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n100.02KB\n)\nDocument\nPrimary-Catholic-SIF-2024-25.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n104.75KB\n)\nDocument\nCronton-CE-SIF-2024-25.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n113.96KB\n)\nDocument\nHalewood CE SIF 2025-26.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n121.17KB\n)\nDocument\nHuyton-with-Roby-SIF-2024-25.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n62.2KB\n)\nDocument\nKirkby-CE-SIF-2024-25.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n280.78KB\n)\nDocument\nSt-Mary-and-St-Paul-s-SIF-2024-25.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n92.1KB\n)",

    "text": "Knowsley’s Education Service believe that, in most cases, the best place to educate a child is in school. However, the Service acknowledges that parents have the right to elect to educate their child or children at home per Section 7 of the 1996 Education Act. Home-based education is the “otherwise” part of the act, and some parents choose to do this because they judge it as the best way to carry out their duty to educate their child.\nParents need to be fully informed when deciding to remove their child from a school’s roll and to provide home education. There are many big decisions to consider and there is a need to appreciate what a child would no longer have access to if they are no longer on the roll of a school. One of the most important implications for electing to home educate is that all the financial responsibility for your child(ren) 's learning is yours. Unfortunately, there is no funding available from within the Council to support your child’s education and exams unless they are on a school roll. The cost of books, equipment, educational visits and any costs for a tutor, if required, will be the responsibility of you, the parent.\nKnowsley’s Elective Home Education policy\naims to help parents understand what may be involved if they are thinking of educating their child in this way. We hope it will help you to consider all the implications of Elective Home Education, explain the law as it applies to you and the Council, and how this works in Knowsley. In addition, there is also the\nDfE’s Elective Home Education: guide for parents\nwhich provides information on the national guidance.\nFor more information, please call 0151 443 5177, or e-mail\nElectiveHome.Education@knowsley.gov.uk\n.\nResources\nThe Council recognise that much of the elective home education children and young people engage with can be heavily supported through online resources, activities and web pages. This can be a rich and valuable resource.\nIt is therefore important that parents, who chose to electively home educate their children and utilise the internet to support this, take every step to safeguard their children and keep them safe when they are online.\nAs EHE parents you can do this by ensuring all necessary parental controls are in place and that steps have been taken to ensure that you educate your child about how to keep safe online.\nThe following resources are designed to support young people, adults and parents/carers to keep everyone safe and to provide information  on a variety of safeguarding topics and ways to prevent young people from being contacted in their own homes, on the internet, and exploited in a range of ways.\nKeeping children safe online | NSPCC\nOnline safety and advice resources\nOnline Safety Act: explainer - GOV.U",

    "text": "If you are making a complaint about a school, you must make it directly to the school.\nEach school will have its own policy and procedure. The procedure will tell you who to address the complaint to and when you should expect a response by.\nYou will find the school’s complaints policy on the school website, or you can contact the school office to request a paper copy. A list of all Knowsley schools can be found\nhere\n.\nHow to raise a concern or make a complaint\nAny concerns you have about your child’s education can normally be settled, in the first instance, in an informal way by speaking to your child’s teacher, the office staff, Head of Year or another key staff member.\nBuilding positive relationships is important to schools, and schools recognise that it is in everyone’s best interest that complaints are resolved as soon as possible. Your concerns will be taken seriously, and every effort will be made to resolve matters in accordance with school policy. If you are unsure who to speak to, contact the school office for advice.\nYou should not approach individual governors to raise concerns or complaints—they have no power to act individually, and this may prevent them from considering any formal complaint made at a later stage.\nWhen the school receives a complaint, they will investigate it in accordance with their own procedures.\nFormal complaint\nIf, after the informal stage, the issue is not resolved and you wish to make a formal complaint, you should refer to the school’s complaints procedure for the next steps you need to take.\nThe school complaints procedure will tell you how to make a formal complaint.  There are generally a few stages to this, which are outlined below, but referring to each individual policy for the school’s individual process is essential.\nStage 1\nThe first step is to complete a complaint form or put the issues in writing to the Headteacher. Individual school policies will indicate support that can be extended should it be difficult to express concerns in writing.\nYou should make it clear:\nWhy are you complaining?\nWho have you spoken to already?\nWhat do you want to happen as a result of your complaint?\nThe Headteacher will then investigate the complaint and provide a written response.\nStage 2\nIf the complainant is not satisfied with the outcome of the Stage 1 response, the complainant can move the complaint to Stage 2 of the process, where a written complaint is received directly to the Governing Body/Trust Board. The Chair of Governors/Trust Board will ensure that the complaint was dealt with appropriately at the previous stage and that the complaint is presented to an independent Complaints or Appeal Panel drawn from the governors/trustees.\nA written response detailing decisions and recommendations will be provided.\nStage 3\nIf the complainant remains unhappy with the way in which procedures have been carried out, the complaint can move to Stage 3 of the process.  The complainant will be notified of the right to appeal to the Secretary of State for Education.\nAnonymous complaints\nSchools do not investigate anonymous complaints unless there is sufficient information to warrant an investigation.\nHow long will it take to deal with a formal complaint\nTimescales for dealing with complaints are detailed in individual school complaints policies for each stage.\nWhat to do if you are not satisfied with how the school has handled your complaint\nKnowsley Council does not operate a review service for school complaints or have the authority to intervene or overturn decisions made by the governors. If you remain dissatisfied with the school response, and you have exhausted the school complaints procedure in full, you can contact the Department for Education and request that they review your complaint.\nThis can either be\nonline\nor in writing:\nDepartment for Education\nPiccadilly Gate\nStore Street\nManchester\nM1 2WD\nTelephone: 0370 000 2288",

Only where the admission authority accepts there are exceptional circumstances, will late applications be considered in the initial allocation.\nIf you believe there are exceptional reasons for your application being late, it is your responsibility to confirm this and provide supporting evidence when you make the application. The deadline for exceptional circumstance consideration for late primary school applications is 17 March 2025, any applications received after this date will not be considered until after the initial allocation is complete (after national offer day).\nChange of school preference/s\nUp to the national closing date (15 January 2025), online applicants can make changes to their school preferences by logging into their account via the application portal to make the change and resubmit the application.  Those who have applied by paper application must contact the school admissions service to request a change of preference.\nA change of preference during the allocation period will only be accepted if there are substantial or exceptional reasons, for example a change of address. You should contact Knowsley school admissions service confirming the reasons why a change is being requested and provide evidence of the change of circumstances resulting in a change of preference request, for example proof of exchange of contracts to confirm a house move. The deadline for change of preference due to exceptional circumstance for primary school applications is 17 March 2025, any change requested after this date will not be considered until after the initial allocation is complete (after national offer day).\nMaking a change to your school preferences after national offer day\nAny new application you submit will replace your original/previous application.\nIf your child has been refused a place at a school/s of preference and you plan to appeal and/or want them to remain on the waiting list, you must still list the school/s as preference on your new application. If you did not previously use all your preference options, you can add new preferences, or remove schools previously named - if you no longer wish to continue with the application to them - and name different schools on your new application.\nAny current school offer will not be withdrawn unless a new school offer is being made. You are strongly advised not to refuse a place that has been offered unless you have secured another school place.\nTimeframe for considering late applications\nLate/new applications naming Knowsley schools as preference received up to midnight on 30 April 2025 will be considered together and the outcome confirmed within 10 working days.\nLate/new applications received from 1 May will be processed as quickly as possible and outcomes for Knowsley schools issued within 10 working days.\nLate/new applications for Knowsley residents naming schools in other authority areas will be sent to the relevant authority as soon as is practicable and applicants will be informed of outcomes in accordance with the timeframes of that authority.\nOther changes of circumstances\nIt is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure the information on the application is correct. If a change takes place after the application is submitted, you should notify the school admissions service without delay as this may affect how the application is considered. A place may be withdrawn if it is offered based on information on the application that is incorrect.\nIf the change is in relation to information provided on a supplementary information form, you should contact the individual school directly to discuss making a change to the form.\nIf you are unsure about what is a relevant change,\ncontact Knowsley School Admissions Service\nfor advice.",

    "text": "Applications for places in year 7 of secondary schools for the current school year 2024/25 should now be made by following in-year admission/transfer procedures for Knowsley secondary schools.\nLate applications for admission to secondary school in September 2025 after the national closing date of 31 October\nIf you live in Knowsley and have not yet applied for your child to transfer to secondary education in September 2025, or if you want to make a new application, you can do this by visiting the online application portal, which will remain open until 31 August 2025.\nTo make a late application you can access the online portal here\nAlternatively, contact the school admissions team to request a paper application form.\nIf you live in another authority area but would like to apply for a place in a Knowsley school, contact your home authority who will co-ordinate your late application.\nSome schools require a supplementary information form to be completed in addition to the application form – find more information about this at\nSupplementary Information Forms | Knowsley Council\nApplications received after the allocation process has begun\nApplications received after the initial allocation process has begun, will not be considered by the admission authorities of Knowsley schools until the initial allocation process is complete. Only where the admission authority accepts there are exceptional circumstances, will late applications be considered in the initial allocation.\nIf you believe there are exceptional reasons for your application being late, it is your responsibility to confirm this and provide supporting evidence when you make the application. The deadline for exceptional circumstance consideration for late secondary school applications is 20 January 2025, any applications received after this date will not be considered until after the initial allocation is complete (after national offer day).\nChange of school preference/s\nUp to the national closing date (31 October 2024), online applicants can make changes to their school preferences by logging into their account via the application portal to make the change and resubmit the application.  Those who have applied by paper application must contact the school admissions service to request a change of preference.\nA change of preference during the allocation period will only be accepted if there are substantial or exceptional reasons, for example a change of address. You should contact Knowsley school admissions service confirming the reasons why a change is being requested and provide evidence of the change of circumstances resulting in a change of preference request, for example proof of exchange of contracts to confirm a house move. The deadline for change of preference due to exceptional circumstance for secondary school applications is 20 January 2025, any change requested after this date will not be considered until after the initial allocation is complete (after national offer day).\nMaking a change to your school preferences after national offer day\nAny new application you submit will replace your original/previous application.\nIf your child has been refused a place at a school/s of preference and you plan to appeal and/or want them to remain on the waiting list, you must still list the school/s as preference on your new application. If you did not previously use all your preference options, you can add new preferences, or remove schools previously named - if you no longer wish to continue with the application to them - and name different schools on your new application.\nAny current school offer will not be withdrawn unless a new school offer is being made. You are strongly advised not to refuse a place that has been offered unless you have secured another school place.\nTimeframe for considering late applications\nLate/new applications naming Knowsley schools as preference received up to midnight on 17 March 2025 will be considered together and the outcome confirmed within 10 working days.\nLate/new applications received from 18 March will be processed as quickly as possible and outcomes for Knowsley schools issued within 10 working days.\nLate/new applications for Knowsley residents naming schools in other authority areas will be sent to the relevant authority as soon as is practicable and applicants will be informed of outcomes in accordance with the timeframes of that authority.\nOther changes of circumstances\nIt is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure the information on the application is correct. If a change takes place after the application is submitted, you should notify the school admissions service without delay as this may affect how the application is considered. A place may be withdrawn if it is offered based on information on the application that is incorrect.\nIf the change is in relation to information provided on a supplementary information form, you should contact the individual school directly to discuss making a change to the form.\nIf you are unsure about what is a relevant change, contact Knowsley School Admissions Service for advice.",

It does not apply to the annual allocation of reception class places in primary school or year 7 places in secondary schools.\nThe Fair Access Protocol ensures that no individual school is asked to admit a disproportionate number of children who have been excluded from other schools or who display challenging behaviour, or who are being placed via other categories of the protocol.\nThe Fair Access Panel does not have to comply with parental preference for a school place and can agree placements beyond the usual admission limit, or refuse where places might otherwise be available.\nThe Knowsley Fair Access protocol can be found below:\nDocument\nKnowsley Fair Access Protocol.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n158.35KB\n)",
