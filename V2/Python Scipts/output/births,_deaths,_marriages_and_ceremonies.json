You can get  this permission through an approved memorial stone mason, who can also advise you on sizes, wording, and construction.\nThe memorial stone mason will also contact the cemetery to make sure that the headstone meets size and health and safety standards.\nSome headstones can be installed immediately following burial, but in other cases there may need to be a delay to allow the ground to settle.\nOnce positioned, it is the owner's responsibility to care for the headstone and arrange for any upkeep. You may want to consider taking out insurance to cover the cost of any damage.\nMemorial plaques\nThere are two types of memorial plaque available.\nOne that can be displayed on the Garden of Remembrance wall and one that can be displayed on a \"mushroom\" memorial.\nBoth types of plaque can be leased for a ten-year period, with the option to renew the lease when it ends.\nThere is no further charge for maintenance or upkeep during the period of the lease. Prices vary depending on the type of plaque you choose.\nHow to apply for a plaque\nTo apply for a plaque, complete and return an application form to Knowsley Bereavement Services Office.\nDownloads\nDocument\nStonemasons currently registered with Knowsley Borough Council.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n14.39KB\n)\nDocument\nApplication for A New Memorial (1).pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n91.03KB\n)\nContact\nAddress\nKnowsley Bereavement Services Office\nKnowsley Council Register Office\nHigh Street Prescot\nL34 3LH\nE-mail\nknowsley.bereavement.services@knowsley.gov.uk\nTelephone\n0151 443 5231",
