These include trees that are considered dead, dying, diseased, or dangerous, as well as fruit trees grown commercially for fruit production.\nTrees that grow on council-owned property or on public open spaces are also protected as they are deemed as council property. Anyone damaging these can be prosecuted.\nIf you are doing work close to trees you should make sure that trees surrounding any development sites are protected by fencing. You can be subject to a fine should any trees be damaged during the development process.\nMore information\nDocument\nTree care protection advice.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n175.47KB\n)",

    "text": "Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA)\nThe National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) is a set of rules that the government uses to make decisions about planning and development. The NPPF says that local authorities should have a clear understanding of the land available for housing in their area. To do this, they should carry out a Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA)\nA SHLAA is a report that identifies and assesses land that could be used for housing development. It considers factors such as how much land is available, whether it is suitable for housing, and whether it would be economically viable to develop.\nThe purpose of a SHLAA is to make sure that there is enough land available to meet the housing needs of an area. It can also be used to decide where to build new homes in local plans.\nThe first SHLAA, published in March 2010, was carried out jointly with Knowsley, Sefton and West Lancashire Council. Updates for Knowsley were conducted in 2011, 2012, 2016, 2022, 2023, and 2024.\nDocuments\nSHLAA 2024\nDocument\nKnowsley Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment – 2024 Update.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n17.93MB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix E Housing Commitments Forecast.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n258.22KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix F Local Plan Housing Allocations Forecast.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n189.71KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix G SHLAA Sites Forecast.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n372.84KB\n)\nSHLAA 2023\nDocument\nKnowsley-Strategic-Housing-Land-Availability-Assessment-–-2023-Update (1).docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n14.44MB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix-F-Housing-Commitments-Forecast_1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n11.34KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix-G-Local-Plan-Housing-Allocations-Forecast_1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n5.68KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix-H-SHLAA-Sites-Forecast_1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n83.13KB\n)\nSHLAA 2022\nDocument\nSHLAA-2022-Update.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n5.68MB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix-F-Housing-Commitments-Forecast.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n310.71KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix-G-Local-Plan-Housing-Allocations-Forecast.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n79.4KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix-H-SHLAA-Sites-Forecast.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n82.89KB\n)\nOlder\nDocument\nKnowsley-SHLAA-Report-2016-Update-Final-Report-Draft-wo-app.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n210.32KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix-One-to-Three.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n3.8MB\n)\nDocument\nDatasheet_Excluded-2_Part1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n2.99MB\n)\nDocument\nDatasheet_Excluded-2_Part2.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n3MB\n)\nDocument\nDatasheet_Excluded-2_Part3_1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n743.82KB\n)\nDocument\nEB01_StrategicHousingLandAvailabilityAssessment-2012.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n16.38MB\n)\nDocument\nEB02_StrategicHousingLandAvailabilityAssessment-2011Update.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n8.79MB\n)\nDocument\nEB03_StrategicHousingLandAvailabilityAssessment-2010.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n6.24MB\n)\nCall for Sites Exercise\nKnowsley Council invites anyone interested in proposing land for new housing development to submit their suggestions. The cut-off date for submission is 1 June annually to be considered in the SHLAA for the corresponding year.\nThe main purpose of the SHLAA is to identify land that could be used for housing and to assess how likely it is to be developed. This helps the council to understand whether there is enough land available to meet the housing needs of the local area.\nThe SHLAA is not a statement of council policy, it does not allocate land for housing, and it does not signal the start of a new Local Plan. The base date for each SHLAA will be April 1 of the year in which the SHLAA is carried out.\nAnyone interested in proposing land for housing development can do so by completing a Call for Sites Form and submitting it to the council. The form should also include a plan of the land that is being proposed. The council will consider all proposals that are submitted, but they will be assessed against planning policy and other relevant planning considerations. Submitting a proposal does not guarantee that the council will include the land in the SHLAA or that the land will be used for housing development.\nDownload form\nDocument\nKnowsley Call For Sites Form 2024.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n37.94KB\n)\nReturn to\nEmail\nlocalplan@knowsley.gov.uk\nPost\nPlanning Policy Team\nKnowsley Council\nHuyton Library\nCivic Way\nHuyton\nKnowsley\nL36 6GD",

Knowsley has over 100 listed buildings, including one Grade I building, four Grade II* buildings, and the remainder listed at Grade II.\nGrades of listed buildings\nGrade I\nBuildings of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important.\nGrade II:*\nParticularly important buildings of more than special interest.\nGrade II\nNationally important and of special interest.\nConsent for work on listed buildings\nYou must get consent from the council before carrying out any work that affects the special interest of a listed building. This includes restorations, alterations, demolitions, and extensions. The requirement for consent also applies to internal works and works affecting outbuildings and other structures associated with the principal listed building.\nPenalties for unauthorised work\nUndertaking work to a listed building that affects its special interest without first gaining Listed Building Consent is a criminal offence. If you are in any doubt whether you require consent for works, you should contact Planning Services at 0151 443 2380 for advice.\nMaintenance of listed buildings\nIf you own a listed building, you are responsible for its maintenance.

They can confirm whether it's listed and the extent of permitted modifications without requiring listed building consent.\nProtection offered by listing\nListing grants a building legal protection from demolition or alterations that could compromise its significance as a structure of architectural or historical importance. This protection covers both the exterior and interior of the building, as well as any fixtures or structures attached to it or within its curtilage.\nListed building consent requirements\nListed Building Consent (LBC) is mandated for any works, including demolition, alteration, or extension to a listed building, that might jeopardise its architectural or historical significance. This includes changes to the building's interior and works that affect the building's surroundings.\nApplying for listing\nAny individual can propose that a building be listed, and applications should be submitted to Historic England.

Please visit our\nConservation Areas page\nfor more information on these areas, to view their Appraisals and Management Plans and also find guidance on applying for Planning Permission for work which affects land and property in, or affecting the setting of, a Conservation Area.\nListed Buildings\nThere are currently over 100 Listed Buildings within the borough of Knowsley. Please visit our\nListed Buildings page\nfor more information on these properties including their addresses and grading, and guidance on applying for Listed Building Consent and/or Planning Permission for work that affects a listed building or its setting.\nHistoric Parks and Gardens\nThe Register of Historic Parks and Gardens is maintained by\nHistoric England\nand includes a range of parks, gardens and cemeteries which are chosen for their special historic interest.\nWithin Knowsley there are two historic parks:\nKnowsley Park\nis registered at Grade II.  It has its origins in the 13th Century and has since been altered and enlarged several times.\nCroxteth Hall Park\nis also registered at Grade II, it is mostly sited within Liverpool City Council’s area, however a small portion of the 19th century landscaped park extends into Knowsley.\nIf you wish to find out more about how sites are chosen or suggest a site for designation as a historic park and garden, advice is available on\nHistoric England’s\nwebsite.\nPlanning applications for works which affect Historic Parks or Gardens or their settings are required to be supported by a\nheritage statement\n.\nArchaeology\nKnowsley has no designated Scheduled Monuments, but its past has left a rich legacy of archaeological remains which require consideration when development proposals are brought forward through the planning process. The council takes advice on archaeology from\nMerseyside Environmental Advisory Service\n, which maintains the\nMerseyside Historic Environment Record (HER)\nas a source of information about the archaeology and historic buildings of Knowsley.\nIf your development may affect archaeology, you will be expected to undertake a suitable level of assessment as part of the planning process.\nNon-designated heritage assets\nAlongside ‘designated’ heritage assets (such as listed buildings, conservation areas etc.), there are many sites that do not quite meet the criteria for formal designation, but which are of local historic interest. These historic features and places add to the quality and interest of the local scene and are often valued by local people. The effect of development on non-designated heritage assets is a material consideration in determining relevant planning applications.\nThe type of features which can be considered non-designated heritage assets is wide ranging, including buildings, structures, monuments, archaeological sites and landscapes.\nPlanning applications which affect non-designated heritage assets, whether it is included in a ‘local list’ should be accompanied by a\nHeritage Statement\n.\nKnowsley Council has begun to develop a Local List of buildings and structures of historic or architectural interest to help identify locally important non-designated heritage assets.  The Merseyside Local List project was developed with government funding as part of a shared scheme with Wirral and Sefton Councils.\nDevelopment of Knowsley’s individual local list is currently paused. Nominations made as part of the initial project remain under consideration.\nGrant Aid\nPlease visit our Grant Aid page\nhere\nto access information about the Prescot High Street Heritage Action Zone (HSHAZ), the Prescot Townscape Heritage Initiative (THI) grant scheme and find links to other potential sources of heritage grant funding.\nPre-application Advice\nIf you are considering applying for permission for works to a designated or undesignated heritage asset you can seek our advice on your proposals before submitting an application.  Please see our pre-application advice page\nhere\nfor details.",

SPDs are non-statutory documents that can elaborate on specific sites, particular issues, or general planning principles. They serve as valuable tools for ensuring that development aligns with the overall vision and objectives outlined in the Local Plan.\nLocal Development Order\nThe Knowsley Industrial and Business Parks Local Development Order (LDO) was a planning instrument that aimed to simplify the planning permission process for development within the Knowsley Industrial and Business Parks. The LDO was designed to support the regeneration of the Parks and maximize their contribution to the local and sub-regional economy.\nThe LDO expired on January 28, 2018, and its policies are no longer in force. However, the LDO played a significant role in facilitating development and investment within the Knowsley Industrial and Business Parks during its lifespan.\nKnowsley Industrial and Business Parks: Local Development Order and Statement of Reasons and Order Design Code\nDocument\nPP29-Draft-Local-Development-Order-KIP-and-KBP-v2.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n2.72MB\n)\nDocument\nLocal-Development-Order-Design-Code-v2.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.59MB\n)\nStatement of Community Involvement\nThe Statement of Community Involvement is the document that explains how Knowsley Council will involve the community in planning issues.

The LDS serves several crucial purposes:\nInforms the public\nIt provides a starting point for the residents of Knowsley to learn about the borough's planning policies and how they can participate in the process.\nDefines the scope\nIt outlines which planning policy documents we will create as part of the Local Plan, specifying when they will be produced.\nEstablishes a timeline\nIt sets a timetable for reviewing the planning policy documents once they have been finalised.\nThe LDS is an essential tool for ensuring that the Local Plan is developed in a transparent, efficient, and inclusive manner. By providing clear timelines and engaging with the public, the LDS helps to ensure that the Local Plan meets the needs of the Knowsley community.\nDocument\nKnowsley_LDS_Final_March 2025.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n57.09KB\n)\nLiverpool City Region Spatial Planning Statement of Common Ground\nThe Liverpool City Region Spatial Planning Statement of Common Ground has been agreed between the local authorities of Halton, Knowsley, Liverpool, St. Helens, Sefton, West Lancashire and Wirral, along with the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.\nThe Statement has been prepared jointly in response to the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019) requirement for strategic policy-making authorities to document agreement and cooperation on cross boundary strategic planning matters1.

In parished areas of Knowsley, only the local Parish or Town Council can lead on Neighbourhood Planning for your community. In non-parished areas of the Borough, a community gathering known as a Neighbourhood Forum needs to be established to lead the process.\nIn either case, the qualifying community body (Parish/Town Council or prospective Neighbourhood Forum) needs to apply to Knowsley Council to have an area designated as a Neighbourhood Area.  This will then become the area where Neighbourhood Plans apply.",

The main objective of the SPD is to ensure a good choice of travel modes to all new developments in Knowsley.  It can be used by developers to ensure that their proposals are accessible, promote sustainable travel patterns and minimise the congestion and pollution caused by vehicles. It will be used to assess planning applications in relation to transport requirements.\nThe SPD does not contain dimensions for car-parking spaces and manoeuvring areas.  These can be found in the Department for Transport document “Manual for Streets”.\nAlthough the SPD covers the Knowsley Borough, it was developed in close partnership with the other districts on Merseyside and with Merseytravel. This was to ensure a relatively consistent approach across Merseyside to securing access to new development by a choice of transport modes, i.e. walking, cycling, public transport as well as by private motor vehicles.\nDocument\nTransport_spd_consultationstatement.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n624.86KB\n)\nDocument\nB - Accessibility Assessment Form.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n98.44KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendixCAccessibilityMaps 1 of 3.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n3.15MB\n)\nDocument\nAppendixCAccessibilityMaps 2 of 3.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n2.42MB\n)\nDocument\nAppendixCAccessibilityMaps 3 of 3.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n2.29MB\n)\nDocument\nTransport SPD Adoption Statement 1 Sept 2010.doc.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n87.17KB\n)\nDocument\nTravelSPDLowRes.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.97MB\n)\nDocument\nSustainability Appraisal  Strategic Environmental Assessment-1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.79MB\n)\nDocument\nSustainability Appraisal  Strategic Environmental Assessment Non Technical Summary.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n79.69KB\n)\nDocument\nHabitats Regulations Assessment.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n3.23MB\n)\nDesign Quality in New Development Supplementary Planning Document\nThe Design Quality in New Development Supplementary Planning Document identifies the overarching context for design in the Borough, and highlights Borough-wide issues which should be taken into account in designing new development.  This includes guidance relating to placing buildings, density and form, accessibility, landscaping, public open space, sustainable design, minimising crime, and preserving the built heritage.\nDocument\n27-Design-Quality-in-New-Development-SPD.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n5.24MB\n)\nShopfronts and Signage Design Supplementary Planning Document\nThe Shopfronts and Signage Design Supplementary Planning Document provides detailed guidance to developers on specific issues relating to design of new and altered shop fronts and signage.  This includes best practice on shop front composition, proportion, styles, materials, colours and security, together with requirements of signage in terms of types, position and illumination.\nDocument\nKnowsley-Shopfront-and-Signage-Design-SPD-Consultation-Statement-14-06-2023-2023.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n161.97KB\n)\nDocument\nKnowsley-Shopfront-and-Signage-Design-SPD-Adoption-Statement-14-06-2023.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n139.94KB\n)\nDocument\nShopfront-and-Signage-Design-SPD-Adoption-Version-08-06-2023.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n2.26MB\n)\nDeveloper Contributions SPD\nThis SPD supplements the Core Strategy policies by providing detailed guidance on how developer contributions will operate in Knowsley.

    "text": "Building regulations are performance levels set by Parliament that govern the construction of buildings and the installation of certain services. They are designed to safeguard the health and safety of people in or around buildings, as well as promote energy conservation and accessibility for disabled individuals in new offices, shops, and public buildings.\nEnforcement of building regulations is carried out by building control officers, who review plans for compliance and conduct on-site inspections during construction. These regulations apply to the construction of new buildings, extensions or alterations to existing buildings, and changes in building use.\nTo obtain building regulation approval, applicants can choose between two procedures: a full plans application or a building notice. The full plans application requires detailed plans, while the building notice procedure requires less detailed plans. The choice between these two options depends on the complexity of the project and the applicant's experience with construction.\nNeighbours do not have the right to object to building regulation applications. However, objections may be raised under separate legislation, such as the Planning Acts or party wall legislation.\nFees are payable for building regulation applications, except for exempt work. The council will advise applicants of the applicable fee, which may vary depending on the procedure chosen.\nOnce a building notice has been given or full plans have been submitted, work can begin at any time, but the council must be notified two working days in advance. However, starting work before approval is received may limit the applicant's options for disputing a rejection.\nInformation on building standards can be found in approved documents published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office. These documents provide practical guidance on meeting the requirements of the regulations. However, alternative solutions are also acceptable if they can be demonstrated to comply with the regulations.\nIf building plans are rejected, they can be resubmitted with amendments or the matter can be referred to the Secretary of State for the Environment for a determination.\nUnapproved building work may be required to be altered or removed. If the owner fails to comply, the council may serve a notice requiring them to do so.\nUnauthorised building work that commenced on or after November 11, 1985 can now be regularised.\nFor more information, contact building control on 443 2380 or refer to the Building Act 1984, the Building Regulations, and the accompanying Approved Documents. These documents are available at the Building Control office, the Reference Library, and HMSO.\nTo find a registered electrical contractor, visit\nNICEIC.",

In Knowsley, the rock is called Bowland shale.\nKnowsley Council's opposition to fracking\nThe council\nagreed a motion in September 2015\nopposing fracking and other unconventional gas extraction methods in Knowsley and surrounding areas.\nKnowsley Council is opposed to fracking and other unconventional gas extraction methods because:\nThe processes have not been proven to be safe.\nThe potential negative impacts on health and the environment have not been fully addressed.\nThere is no evidence of economic benefits of fracking.\nGovernment's stance on fracking\nThe Government\nsupports\nexploring the potential of shale gas, via methods such as fracking. They have issued licenses for companies to explore for shale gas in different areas of the country, including Knowsley.\nThe Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has issued licences for companies to begin exploring sites across the country for shale gas. In 2015, the Government set up an\nOil and Gas Authority (OGA)\nto oversee oil and gas licensing and development including shale.\nPotential for fracking in Knowsley\nThere is shale rock approximately 1,000 meters beneath Knowsley that is potentially gas-bearing. The full potential of the area is not yet known.\nAn area in the north of the borough, near Tower Hill in Kirkby, is within one of the exploration blocks awarded by the Government in the\nrecent licensing round\n.\nUncertainty of fracking in Knowsley\nThe award of these licenses by the Government does not automatically mean that exploration or drilling for shale gas and/or oil can begin.\nKnowsley Council's authority over fracking applications\nKnowsley's Planning Committee can reject any application for fracking if it considers it does not meet national legislation and planning rules.\nPlanning Committee must consider any application on its merits and the following issues are likely to be of particular relevance to shale gas and/or oil planning applications:\nNoise\nDust\nAir quality\nLighting\nVisual intrusion\nLandscape character\nArchaeological and heritage features\nTraffic\nRisk of contamination of the land\nSoil resources\nThe impact on agricultural land\nFlood risk\nLand stability/subsidence\nInternationally, nationally and locally designated sites and species for nature conservation and biodiversity\nNationally protected geological and geomorphological sites and features\nPlans for site restoration and aftercare\nCumulative or in-combination effects\nThese are some of the main issues and material considerations, alongside national and local policy, upon which the Planning Committee can base its decision whether to grant planning permission, regardless of the council’s opposition to fracking in principle.\nPlanning applications for fracking in Knowsley\nTo date, Knowsley Council has not received any planning applications from companies wishing to carry out investigations, testing, or fracking for shale gas and/or oil in Knowsley.\nFinding out about fracking planning applications\nYou can look at all planning applications submitted to Knowsley Council on the planning section of their website. You can also read the agendas and related reports for meetings of the Planning Committee in this section.\nAdditional information\nFor more information on the Government's stance on fracking, please visit the Department of Energy and Climate Change website.\nFor more information on the Oil and Gas Authority, please visit their website.",

    "text": "Pre-application measures can streamline the application process, leading to a faster decision and saving you time and effort.\nFor initial inquiries, contact the Planning Services team at 0151 443 2381 (between 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday) for further guidance on the process.\nBenefits of advice\nObtaining formal pre-application advice can significantly enhance your chances of success when submitting a planning application. Here are some of the key benefits:\nA clear understanding of how your application will be assessed\nPre-application advice can help you understand how your proposal aligns with the Council's policies and other relevant considerations. This can help you identify potential issues early on and make informed decisions about your proposal.\nReduced time and costs\nBy addressing potential issues early on, pre-application advice can help you avoid spending unnecessary time and money on developing a proposal that is unlikely to be approved.\nIdentification of specialist advice\nPre-application advice can help you identify if you need to seek specialist advice from professionals such as architects, engineers, or environmental consultants.\nEarly identification of unacceptable proposals\nPre-application advice can help you identify if your proposal is unlikely to be approved, saving you the time and expense of pursuing a formal application.\nGuidance on application requirements\nPre-application advice can provide you with specific guidance on the information you need to submit to ensure your application is valid and complete.\nImproved proposal quality\nPre-application advice can help you develop and refine your proposal to make it more acceptable to the Council, increasing your chances of success.\nTailored advice\nPre-application advice is tailored to the specific details of your development, providing you with personalised guidance that is relevant to your project.\nOverall, obtaining pre-application advice is a valuable investment that can significantly improve your chances of success when submitting a planning application. By addressing potential issues early on, you can save time, money, and effort while increasing your likelihood of achieving your development goals.\nCharges\nThe Council has decided that developers will pay for pre-application advice, not taxpayers. The current planning application fees don't cover the cost of this advice.\nFor each type of development a charge will apply for formal pre-application advice given by the Council. The charges are outlined in detail in the pre-application fee guide. All charges are inclusive of VAT.\nDocument\nPre application fees April 2025.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n32.21KB\n)\nPre-application engagement is not mandatory, but it is strongly encouraged\nEngaging with the Council before submitting a planning application is considered to be best practice. This is because it allows Council officers and developers to work together to ensure that the proposed development is sustainable and in line with local planning policies. Early engagement can also help to avoid additional costs and delays that can arise if problems are not identified early on.\nWhilst we will do our best to work positively and proactively with developers, all advice is given without prejudice to the outcome of any subsequent application. Your planning application will be subject to notification/consultation of interested parties and, dependent on the views expressed, this may affect the outcome of your application.\nWhat you must provide\nDownload and complete the pre-application advise request form.\nDocument\nPre-application advise request form.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n509.21KB\n)\nYou will also need to provide:\nSite location plan at an appropriate scale, usually 1:1250 or 1:2500\nDetails of current use and relevant history.  Photographs can be helpful.\nDetails of the nature and scale of the development proposed.  More information may be required if more detailed advice is requested\nSketch drawings of the proposed development to include a proposed layout, floor plans and elevations, sufficient to indicate the scale and height of development proposed.\na list of any key issues for which you require a specific response\nThe relevant basic fee which must be paid in advance before the request is registered. Where there are additional charges e.g for site meetings or additional meetings or hourly charges an invoice will be sent\nProviding an electronic version of all documents submitted will also enable faster internal consultations by email and help us provide you with a more rapid response.\nPre-application responses\nEach response will be tailored to the scheme proposed. Upon receiving your pre-application form and fee we will telephone you to discuss timescales and the scope of the advice required.\nThe Council has a range of technical specialists. The officer will co-ordinate the input of these specialists, dependent on the scale and nature of the development proposed. They will be invited to attend meetings as considered necessary by the planning officer.\nOther pre-application advice\nKnowsley Council strongly encourages consultation with Merseyside Environmental Advisory Service (MEAS) as part of the pre-application process to help facilitate the development management process where appropriate.  When we receive a request for pre-application advice, if we identify a need, then we may pass details of your pre-application request to MEAS within 24 hours unless you advise otherwise.  You may wish to contact MEAS directly by emailing\nmeasdcconsultations@eas.sefton.gov.uk\nor calling 0151 934 4951.\nWhere to send the required information, form and fee\nPre-application enquiries can either be submitted via email or post.\nEmail\nplanning@knowsley.gov.uk\nBy post\nKnowsley Metropolitan Borough Council\nPO Box 26\nArchway Road\nHuyton\nL36 9FB\nThe fee can be paid\nonline\n, (please ensure, when you have made the payment you forward the confirmation receipt to\ndcsubmissions@knowsley.gov.uk\n) over the phone by contacting 0151 443 2380 or by sending a cheque through the post.",

You will then need to resubmit new proposals for compliance, accompanied by an additional fee.\nReporting non-compliance with conditions\nIf you are concerned that conditions placed on a planning permission have not been complied with, please see our\nPlanning Enforcement Section\n.",

    "text": "When the Council makes decisions on planning applications, the majority of applications are made by officers under ‘delegated authority’ – only those applications with the greatest public interest tend to be decided by the councillors who sit on the Council’s Planning Committee. The Council’s Constitution sets out how those applications are chosen.\nThe agenda for the Planning Committee is published on the Council’s\ncouncil and elections webpage\nfive working days before the meeting. The majority of Planning Committee meetings are held on Thursdays, so the agenda is typically published on Wednesdays.\nYou can find out if an application that you are interested in will be decided by the Planning Committee by registering to ‘track’ the application on the Council’s\nPlanning Public Access webpage\n.\nWhat happens at the Planning Committee?\nThe agenda for the meeting will include a report for each of the planning applications that will be decided by Planning Committee. The report is prepared by the Council’s expert planning officers and summarises all of the matters that are relevant to deciding the application. The report will weigh up the facts and recommend whether planning permission should be approved or refused.\nPlanning Committee meetings are usually held at 6 pm in the Council Chamber Municipal Building in Huyton Village Town Centre and are ‘live streamed’ on the Council’s website. The meetings are undertaken in accordance with the following procedure:\nThe Chairperson introduces the application.\nA Planning Officer will make a short presentation to members of the Planning Committee based on the agenda report.\nMembers of the public who have registered to speak against the proposed development are invited to address the committee.\nA Planning Officer gives points of clarification on the matters raised.\nCommittee members ask Officers any questions about the objector’s presentation (if Officers are unable to answer, the speaker will be invited to respond, followed by further clarification if required).\nMembers of the public who have registered to speak in favour of the proposed development are invited to address the committee.\nA Planning Officer gives points of clarification on the matters raised.\nCommittee members ask Officers any questions about the supporter’s presentation (if Officers are unable to answer the speaker will be invited to respond, followed by further clarification if required)\nIf they have registered to speak, the applicant or their representative is invited to address the committee.\nA Planning Officer gives points of clarification on the matters raised.\nCommittee members ask Officers any questions about the presentation (if Officers are unable to answer, the speaker will be invited to respond, followed by further clarification if required).\nThe Planning Committee debates the application and asks officers questions.\nThe Planning Committee moves to approve or refuse the application, and a vote is taken.\nThe chairperson informs the meeting of the decision.\nCan I speak at a Planning Committee meeting?\nMeetings of the Planning Committee take part in the Council Chamber in the Municipal Building in Huyton Village Town Centre and are ‘live streamed’ on the Council’s website.\nThe meetings are public, so members of the public can attend and listen to the debate. However, they cannot speak at the meeting unless they have registered to do so.\nAnybody can register to speak at the Planning Committee, but you must register to do so by 12 pm the day before the meeting by emailing\nplanning.speaking@knowsley.gov.uk\nwith the following information:\nYour name, address and telephone number.\nApplication number and details of the relevant application.\nWhether you support or oppose the application.\nIf you are happy for your details to be shared with others who register the same request to speak. This will enable you to arrange who speaks and for how long.\nWhether you are nominating anybody to speak on your behalf. If so, you need to provide their name and contact details.\nYou must provide the details listed above. Please do not seek to use this as an opportunity to restate or add to your representations already made to Planning Services.\nYou can contact Democratic Services on\n0151 443 3582\nbefore the 12 pm deadline to make sure they have received your request. You should allow enough time to comply with the procedure in the event that they have not received your request.\nIf an item is deferred you must register your request to speak again, requests to speak will not be ‘carried over’.\nYou should arrive at the committee meeting at least 15 minutes before it starts and alert the Committee Clerk of your presence.\nWhat matters can I raise?\nThe Planning Committee can only consider certain matters, which are called ‘material planning considerations’. In order to make the best use of your time, you should ensure that your presentation does not include matters that are not material planning considerations.\nIf your presentation includes ‘non-material’ matters, Council Officers will tell the Planning Committee that they must not consider them when deciding the application. There is not an exhaustive list of what are and aren’t material planning considerations, but the\nPlanning Portal\nsets out some common matters.\nImpacts on house prices, loss of a view, the character of an applicant, competition, restrictive covenants, boundary disputes, private rights of access, matters controlled under separate legislation (such as Building Regulations, Environmental Permits etc) are not material considerations.\nHow long will I have to speak?\nThe Council allows public speakers a minimum of 3 minutes; however, for those applications that have generated the most public interest, more time is allocated as set out in the table below (the Chairperson may agree to an extension of speaking times if there are exceptional circumstances).\nFewer than 50 representations**\n51 - 200 representations**\n201 or more representations**\nApplicant\n3 minutes\n5 minutes\n8 minutes\nWard Councillors\n3 minutes\n5 minutes\n8 minutes\nPublic Objectors\n3 minutes\n5 minutes\n8 minutes\nPublic Supporters\n3 minutes\n5 Minutes\n8 minutes\n** A representation is defined as an individual letter (not a circular style letter or petition).\nSpeaking time is evenly distributed between the speakers in each of the categories (e.g. if there are 3 public objectors, they will each be given 1 minute to speak). However, the number of public speakers in each category is capped, so no one person has less than 1 minute to address the committee (i.e. if objectors have 3/5/8 minutes available, only 3/5/8 people can speak in objection to an application). In order to make the best use of the committee’s time, no speaker will be allocated more than 3 minutes.\nIf the number of people registered exceeds the number of slots, then the registered speakers will be given the opportunity to elect a spokesperson. In the unlikely event that they are unable or unwilling to do so, the Committee’s Clerk will draw names from a hat.",

    "text": "About planning enforcement\nPlanning enforcement addresses situations where development has occurred without the necessary permission. This includes:\nUnauthorised construction or extensions\nUnauthorised advertisements\nUnauthorised work on protected trees\nFailure to comply with planning permission conditions\nUnauthorised changes to land or building usage\nUntended or dilapidated land or buildings that negatively impact the surrounding area's visual appeal\nWhen planning enforcement action is taken\nThe council carefully assesses the extent of harm caused or likely to be caused by the unauthorised development before deciding whether to take enforcement action. Harm can result from various factors, such as:\nNoise disturbance or nuisance from business operations\nIncreased traffic flows causing danger and disruption\nLoss of privacy, impact on outlook, overshadowing, and reduced natural light\nAdverse visual impact due to poor design or inappropriate materials\nDamage or loss of protected trees, buildings, or buildings in conservation areas\nPollution risk endangering people or the environment\nDevelopments that undermine the integrity of national and local planning policies\nUntidy land or dilapidated or derelict buildings that negatively impact the surrounding area's visual appeal\nWhat happens when action is taken\nIf planning enforcement action is deemed necessary, the council has a range of statutory powers at its disposal to:\nGather information about the activities and individuals involved\nTake steps to rectify unauthorised developments or uses\nServe statutory notices outlining the necessary actions to remedy the breach of planning control\nUndertake works in default if necessary\nProsecute offenders\nSeek court injunctions\nEnforcement notices\nAn enforcement notice may require one or more of the following:\nCessation or prevention of an activity\nRemoval of an unauthorised building or extension\nModifications to an unauthorised development to make it more compliant\nCompliance with planning conditions\nImprovement in the appearance of land or buildings\nStatutory time limits for enforcement action\nThere are statutory time limits within which enforcement action must be taken. Failure to act within these limits results in the breach becoming immune, and the unauthorised development becomes lawful. For instance:\nEnforcement action against building works or the change of use of a building to a single dwelling, including the subdivision of a house into self-contained flats, cannot be taken if the development occurred more than four years ago.\nThe time limit for other changes of use or non-compliance with planning conditions is ten years.\nThere is no statutory time limit for taking action against breaches of listed building control.\nAnyone receiving an enforcement notice can appeal to the Planning Inspectorate.\nGuidance about making an appeal against an enforcement notice\nis also available on Planning Portal.\nMore information on Planning Enforcement can be found on the Department for Communities and Local Government Website,\nEnsuring Effective Enforcement\nand also by visiting Planning Portal,\nHaving your say\nand\nPlanning permission - your responsibilities\n.\nComplaints\nIf you suspect a planning violation, you must file a written complaint. This helps us clearly identify the location, review records, understand the nature of the complaint, conduct further investigation, and provide an appropriate response.\nWhat to include in your complaint\nDetails of the alleged violation or unauthorised activity\nAddress or location of the alleged violation\nDate when the work or activity first started\nThe harm you feel it causes you and the neighbourhood (include photos if helpful)\nName and contact details of the person(s) carrying out the alleged violation (if known)\nYour name, address, and other contact details (essential)\nPlease note\nAnonymous complaints are not accepted.\nYour complaint will be treated confidentially.\nWe will not disclose any information that could identify you unless required for court proceedings.\nHow we handle complaints\nWe receive many reports of alleged planning violations. Some are very serious and may take a long time to investigate. We prioritise cases based on the severity of the violation and the harm caused.\nNegotiation\nWe may consider negotiation before taking formal action if a successful outcome seems possible within a reasonable timeframe. Negotiation is not appropriate when significant harm is being caused.\nResponse times\nWe will acknowledge your complaint in writing (or by email if provided) within five working days.\nPriority levels\nTop priority\nWe will visit the site within 24 hours for alleged violations that could cause irreversible damage, such as demolition of a listed building or unauthorised work on a protected tree.\nHigh priority\nWe will visit the site within five working days for alleged violations that are serious but less immediate, such as significant unauthorised alterations to a dwelling.\nMedium priority and low priority\nWe will visit the site within 10-15 working days for alleged violations that are less likely to cause serious harm, such as changes of use of land or buildings that violate council policy.\nContact\nPlanning Enforcement\nEmail\nplanning.enforcement@knowsley.gov.uk\nTelephone\n0151 443 2380\nAddress\nKnowsley MBC\nPlanning Services\nNutgrove Villa\nWestmorland Road\nL36 6GA",

The line is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\nWhile it's crucial for building owners to maintain their structures to prevent them from posing a risk to the public, there are instances where Building Control may need to intervene, such as following a fire, vehicle impact, or due to inadequate upkeep or neglect.\nUnder the Building Act 1984, Building Control has the authority to take immediate action to address any imminent hazards or initiate legal proceedings through the Magistrates Court if the threat is less immediate.\nWe always prioritise contacting the building owner to provide them with the opportunity to address the issue, but in emergency situations, it may not be possible to reach them if they are unavailable. All expenses incurred will be billed to the building owner and registered as a charge against the property.\nIf you have concerns with the condition of a building and the owner is unwilling to take action, this can be reported to us at\nbcsubmissions@knowsley.gov.uk\nor by telephoning 0151 443 2350.",
