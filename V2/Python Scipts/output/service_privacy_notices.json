    "text": "Who Will Own My Data Once I Submit It?\nKnowsley Metropolitan Borough Council\nWhy Do You Need My Information?\nStatutory function-Identifying and Tracing Children Missing Education and those vulnerable groups who may go missing from Education.\nWhat Allows You to Use My Information?\nThe Children Act 2004 places a duty on all agencies to work together to promote the welfare of children and to share information. This principle underpins this policy and there is an expectation that all agencies will work together to ensure that children do not “slip through the net” and become missing.\nChildren Missing Education (CME) Relevant Legislation and Guidance\nThere are various statutory duties upon Local Authorities and parents (supplemented by guidance) relating to the provision of education and the safeguarding of the welfare of children and which may be relevant to children missing education. The principal provisions are as follows:\nSection 14(1) of the 1996 Education Act\nprovides that a local education authority must make sure there are sufficient schools for providing education in their area. For these purposes, the schools must be sufficient in number, character and equipment to provide all pupils with the opportunity of appropriate education (s. 14(2)). “Appropriate education” means, broadly education which is desirable in view of the pupils’ different ages, abilities and aptitudes and the different periods for which they may be expected to remain at school (s. 14(3)).\nSection 7 of the 1996 Education Act\nprovides that the parent of every child of compulsory school age shall cause him to receive efficient full-time education suitable to his age, ability and aptitude and to any special educational needs he may have, either by regular attendance at school or otherwise.\nFurthermore\nSection 437 (1) of the 1996 Education Act\nprovides that if it appears to a local education authority that a child of compulsory school age in their area is not receiving suitable education, either by regular attendance at school or otherwise, they must serve a notice in writing on the parent (“a school attendance order”) requiring him to satisfy them within the period specified in the notice that the child is receiving such education.\nSection 19 (1) of the 1996 Education Act\nrequires every local education authority to make arrangements for the provision of suitable education at school or otherwise than at school for those children of compulsory school age who by reason of illness, exclusion from school or otherwise, may not for any period receive suitable education unless such arrangements are made for them. For these purposes, “suitable” education is defined as “efficient education suitable to the age, ability, aptitude and to any special educational needs the child (or young person) may have.” (s. 19(6)).\nMoreover, section\n19(4A) of the 1996 Education Act\nprovides:\n“In determining what arrangements to make under subsection (1) in the case of any child or pupil, a local education authority shall have regard to guidance given from time to time by the Secretary of State.”\nSection 175 of the Education Act 2002\n(which came into force on June 1 2004) imposes a duty upon Children’s Services Authorities and governing bodies to exercise their functions with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children. For these purposes, “functions” includes the powers and duties of Children’s Services Authorities and governing bodies.\nThe Children Act 2004\n(which received royal assent on November 15 2004) includes various provisions relating to safeguarding and promotion of welfare of children, including:\n(a)      a duty upon each The Knowsley Council to promote co-operation between it and various other bodies to improve the well-being of children so far as relating to (amongst other things) education and training;\n(b)      a duty upon various bodies (including children’s services authorities) to make arrangements for ensuring that their functions are discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children (due to take effect on 1 October 2005); and\n(c)      provision for the Secretary of State to put into place information databases for the purposes of arrangements under s.175 of the Education Act 2002 or (a) and (b) above, and a framework for the sharing of information contained in such databases for such purposes.\nEducation and Inspections Act 2006 (section 4 & 38)\nDuty to identify children not receiving education\n(1)  In Chapter 2 of Part 6 of EA 1996 (school attendance) before the cross-heading preceding section 437 insert—\n“Children not receiving suitable education\n436A Duty to make arrangements to identify children not receiving Education\n(1)  A local education authority must make arrangements to enable them to establish (so far as it is possible to do so) the identities of children in their area who are of compulsory school age but—\n(a)  Are not registered pupils at a school, and\n(b)  Are not receiving suitable education otherwise than at a school.\n(2)  In exercising their functions under this section a local education authority must have regard to any guidance given from time to time by the Secretary of State.\n(3)  In this Chapter, “suitable education”, in relation to a child, means efficient full-time education suitable to his age, ability and aptitude and to any special educational needs he may have.”\n(2)  In section 437 of EA 1996, in subsection (8) omit the definition of “suitable education”.\n(3)  In section 580 of EA 1996 (index) for the entry in the second column which relates to the expression “suitable education (in Chapter 2 of Part 6)” substitute “section 436A(3)”.\nThe relevant lawful bases for processing under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) are as follows:\nArticle 6(1)(e), which states that processing is necessary for the performance of a public task.\nArticle 9(2)(g), which states that the processing of special category data is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest.  This lawful basis is supported by the following

This legislation allows the Partners to share relevant information to ensure that applicants are appropriately housed.\nWho will my information be shared with?\nYour information will be stored on a system that can be accessed by all Partners to the Property Pool Plus scheme. This includes the five local authorities listed above and all Registered Social Landlords who are partners to the scheme.\nYour information will not be accessed by anyone unless they have a genuine “need to know” basis to do so. This means, unless you have applied for a property, changed your circumstances or have contacted a partner agency about progressing an application in any way, your data will not be accessed.\nYour data will be shared in accordance with the\nCabinet Office's National Fraud Initiative\n.

    "text": "This Notice is provided to you under the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations (UK GDPR). UK GDPR is intended to ensure that any personal data you provide is processed only as legally permitted, is accurate, is kept secure, is only shared as required and is destroyed securely.\nThis Notice explains how your personal data will be processed and your rights.\nBackground\nKnowsley Housing Solutions Service provides help & advice on all kinds of housing needs. The Service includes the statutory assessment of housing needs and the statutory requirements in respect of reducing homelessness and is the lead officer for the High Priority Resettlement Panel.\nIf you are seeking housing advice & support, including presenting as homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, then in order to enable the Service to undertake the legally required assessment of your needs and priorities, you will be asked to provide certain information. This information is legally required and will assess not only your housing priority but also the most appropriate form of accommodation for you and any dependents.\nWho will own my data once I submit it?\nKnowsley Council.\nWhy do you need my information?\nWe collect your personal information for the following purposes:\nTo assess your situation.\nTo contact you about your situation and the information you have provided.\nTo request you to provide documents to prove your homelessness or threatened homelessness and your situation.\nTo contact third parties with your personal information to request further personal information about you; and\nRefer you to third parties and/or other agencies that may be able to help you\nTo make a decision based on your circumstances.\nTo deliver statutory duties on homelessness set out in the Housing Act 1996, including Part 7, Homelessness Act 2002 and Homelessness Reduction Act 2017.\nWhat allows you to use my information?\nThe legal basis for collecting and processing your personal information is:\nPerforming or exercising obligations under law (Housing Act 1996 including Part 7, Homelessness Act 2002 and Homelessness Reduction Act 2017.\nSection 59 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 allows the Home Office to share personal data in connection with the settlement of migrants. As a Crown Department, the Home Office (UKVI) will also rely on its Common Law Powers to share personal data with the Local Authority.\nWe also advise and assist under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, the Housing Act 1988, The Housing Act 1996, and the Protection from Eviction Act 1977).\nProcessing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest.\nIn addition, in certain parts of our form, we also ask for your consent to ensure you want us to proceed with assessing your housing needs.\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time; however, any withdrawal may prevent us from providing all or part of the support and services to you that we could otherwise provide. Should you withdraw your consent, then we will inform you if we can provide you with our full support and service or which support and services are thereafter no longer available to you.\nAdditionally, if you fail to provide certain information when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have entered into with you, or we may be prevented from complying with our legal obligations.\nWe will respect your Consent.\nUnder the UK GDPR (Article 6), to enable us to process your personal information and personal information relating to your dependents, a Data Controller needs to have a legal basis. Sometimes, Consent is sufficient. However, as you are presenting as homeless or potentially homeless, we will need to state another legal basis. We believe our legal basis is the fact that:\nThe processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Data Controller is subject.\nAgain, under the GDPR (Article 9), and Schedule 1 paragraph 6 when processing what is known as ‘special category’ data we need to state a legal condition under the GDPR. ‘Special Category’ data is information relating to you or your dependents regarding ethnic origin*, race*, health*, sexual orientation*, religion*, politics, genetics, biometrics, sex life, and trade union membership. As we may collect data relating to those matters marked with an asterisk, we will need to state a condition. Our reason is:\nProcessing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, based on State law, which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject, i.e. the proper allocation of social housing would be a matter of public concern.\nWhat personal information do we process?\nName\nAddress\nFive-year address history\nGender\nSexual orientation (special category data)\nContact telephone numbers\nEmail address\nNational Insurance Number\nDate of birth\nCurrent employment\nCurrent benefits you are in receipt of\nHealth Issues (including drug or alcohol dependency/use) (special category data)\nCriminal offence history and any pending proceedings where applicable\nMedical issues (special category data) and GP contact details (consent basis)\nEthnicity (special category data)\nSchool details, if applicable\nReasons for contacting service\nCurrent/previous agency involvement\nFinancial/Income status\nEmployment status\nImmigration status\nReligious beliefs (special category data)\nHousing need\nHousing Support that you may need to retain your current housing or support you may need in a new tenancy\nNext of kin details\nAny information which is not mandatory will be clearly marked or made clear to you over the telephone to allow you to decide whether you want to provide it or not.\nWill this information be collected only from me?\nIn line with Article 14 of UK GDPR, we will initially receive information only from you. We will also, where appropriate, ask for supporting documents from you to confirm the information you have provided.  We will then share relevant parts of your information with other relevant bodies in order to ensure correct information is supplied. We will share with you responses from these bodies and, where any contrary information is provided, we will give you an opportunity to clarify and/or correct.\nAny contrary information provided which is found to be correct could adversely affect your application for housing or other support. If false information is provided, this could result in a matter being referred to the relevant authorities. Organisations we may collect information from include DWP, Council Benefits office, other Local Authorities, Police, Welfare Support Agencies, Councillors, MPs and any other representatives acting on your behalf.\nWho will my information be shared with?\nTo assist in the assessment of your housing need or your homeless presentation, we may, on occasion, contact and share your circumstances with the following services:\nSocial Housing Providers\nPrivate Landlords\nLetting Agents/Mortgage lending companies\nHealth Partners (NHS medical professionals)\nGP (doctors of associated doctor’ surgery staff)\nAdult Social Care, such as:\nKnowsley Mental Health Team\nLearning Disabilities Team\nOther Adult Social Care Teams, as required\nChildren's Social Care, such as:\nFamily First\nYouth Offending Team\nLeaving Care Team\nOther Children’s Social Care Teams as required.\nOther services within Knowsley Council, e.g. Housing Benefits, Council Tax\nKnowsley Education Services\nAdvice agencies such as Citizens’ Advice Bureau\nDepartment of Work and Pensions\nProperty Pool Plus (Halton, Knowsley, Liverpool, Sefton and Wirral)\nOther Local Authorities\nHarm reduction/addiction services, such as Change Grow Live\nCommissioned Supported Housing Service Providers\nCommissioned Support Providers, such as SHAP\nLocal Solutions\nProbation Services\nPrison Resettlement Services\nKnowsley Works\nPolice\nSolicitors\nCourts\nCredit Reference Agencies\nFriends/Relatives – may be contacted with your consent to see if they can help with your housing situation or provide information regarding your housing situation.\nDo I have to provide this information, and what will happen if I don’t?\nThe information you consent to provide will assist in the assessment of your housing needs and your homeless presentation or your risk of homeless presentation.  Providing the information will reduce the time in which the assessments described will take.\nHow long will you keep this data for and why?\nWe will keep your information for as long as the law specifies, or where the law does not specify this, the information will be stored for a maximum of 6 years.\nHow will my information be stored?\nYour information will be stored electronically within a secure homeless case management system referred to ‘Housing Options Module’ provided by Civica and within the Council’s secure servers. We take every precaution to ensure data is safe and secure; however, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission of data through email to the Housing Solutions Service is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.\nWill this information be used to take automated decisions about me?\nNo\nWill my data be transferred abroad?\nNo\nWhat rights do I have when it comes to my data?\nThe UK GDPR provides several rights regarding how your personal data is processed:\nThe right to subject access – you can see a copy of the personal data that the Council holds about you and find out what it is used for.\nThe right to rectification – you have the right to ask the Council to correct or remove any inaccurate data that we hold about you.\nThe right to erasure (right to be forgotten) you have the right to ask the Council to remove data that we hold about you.\nThe right to restriction – you have the right to ask for your information to be restricted (locked down) on Council systems.\nThe right to data portability – you have the right to ask for your data to be transferred back to you or to a new provider at your request.\nThe right to object – you have the right to ask the Council to stop using your personal data or to stop sending you marketing information or complain about how your data is used.\nThe right to prevent automated decision making – you have the right to ask the Council to stop using your data to make automated decisions about you or to stop profiling your behaviour (where applicable)\nIf you are not happy about the way your personal data is being processed, or if you require further information about how we process your personal data, you can contact the Council’s Data Protection team by emailing\ndata.protection.officer@knowsley.gov.uk\nYou also have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office:-\nWebsite:\nInformation Commissioner's Office (ICO) website\nBy post: The Information Commissioner's Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF\nTelephone: 08456 30 60 60 or 01625 54 57 45\nFurther advice and guidance from the ICO on this issue can be found on the\nICO website\n.",

These relevant conditions are below:\nArticle 6(1)(d) – is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.\nRecital 46 adds that “some processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance, when processing is necessary for humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread”.\nArticle 6(1)(e) – is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.\nSection 8(c) of the Data Protection Act 2018 sets out that such a task must be necessary for the performance of a function conferred on a person by an enactment or rule of law.\nThe processing of special categories of personal data, which includes data concerning a person’s health, are prohibited unless specific further conditions can be met. These further relevant conditions are below:\nArticle 9(2)(i) GDPR – is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health.\nSchedule 1, Part 1, paragraph 1 – is necessary for the performance or exercising obligations or rights which are imposed or conferred by law on the controller or the data subject in connection with employment ), social security or social protection (e.g. Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.\nSchedule 1, Part 1, paragraph 2 – is necessary for the performance or exercising obligations or rights which are imposed or conferred by law on the controller or the data subject in connection with health\nand social care purposes (e.g. provision of health care or treatment or social care regarding COVID-19).\nSchedule 1, Part 1, paragraph 3 – is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health and is carried out by or under the responsibility of a health professional or by another person who, in the circumstances, owes a duty of confidentiality under an enactment or rule of law, e.g. governmental guidance published by Public Health England.\nWho will my information be shared with?\nWe will only share your information with other partner organisations as part of the response to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nWe will not share your information with anyone else unless required to do so under additional legal requirements, for example, to assist the government in containing the spread of COVID-19. This may be where we are required to do so by law to safeguard public safety and at risk of harm or emergencies.\nInformation will not be shared with other parts of the Council for any other non-related purposes.\nAny information which is shared will only be shared on a need-to-know basis with appropriate individuals. Only the minimum information suitable for the purpose will be shared.\nDo I have to provide this information, and what will happen if I don’t?\nThe Council may use the information it already holds and may receive information from partner organisations.\nThe information will be used for the explicit purpose of keeping people safe, putting contingency plans into place, safeguarding the vulnerable and aiding in business continuity.

This is detailed in legislation and guidance including Working Together to Safeguard Children 2015, Children Act 1989, Children Act 2004, Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, Education Acts, Keeping Children Safe in Education 2016.\nThe council is allowed to process personal and sensitive data to achieve these aims under GDPR Articles and the Data Protection Act.\nNecessary to comply with a Legal Obligation\nPublic Task or Statutory Function\nEmployment, Social Security or Social Protection Law\nLegal proceedings (obtaining advice/defending legal rights)\nSubstantial Public Interest\nHealth and Social Care\nNecessary for administration for justice\nWho will my information be shared with?\nWe collect and share information with any organisation who can support our investigations including: Children, parents and families\nSchools and colleges\nEarly Years and Childcare\nHealth Services\nPolice\nChildren’s Social Care Services\nAdult Social Care Services\nHousing Services\nPrison Service\nYouth Offending Teams\nChildren and Family Court Advisory and Support Service\nArmed Services\nVoluntary and private sectors\nFaith Organisations\nPublic Sources (if applicable)\nWho do we collect information about?\nWe collect information about:\nEmployees\nCustomers\nFamilies\nParents\nAdults\nChildren\nSiblings\nOffenders\nComplainants\nService Users\nEmployers – private, voluntary and statutory sectors\nDo I have to provide this information and what will happen if I don’t?\nIt is essential that any allegation of abuse made against a professional who works with children and young people or other member of staff or volunteer in any setting is dealt with fairly, quickly and consistently, in a way that provides effective protection for the child or children and at the same time supports the person who is the subject of the allegation. Each Local Authority has a Designated Officer in post to co-ordinate the management of allegations against those in a position of responsibility for children.\nThe criteria for consideration under Allegation Management would be any adult who works in regulated activity with children or young people and has behaved in a way that has harmed, or may have harmed a child, has committed a criminal offence against or related to a child and has behaved towards a child or children in a way that indicates they pose a risk of harm to children.\nHow long will you keep this data for and why?\nNorth West LADO Retention Policy\nThis policy has been drawn up by the North West LADO group to provide guidance to LADO’s and other agencies around the retention of information that is collated by LADO’s. The policy needs to be considered in line with each LADO’s own organisation’s retention policy.\nThe purpose of the guidance is to ensure that agencies are fully aware of what information will be retained, for what purpose and for how long.\nPrior to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, there was no National Government Guidance in place to advice LADO’s around how long information should be retained.\nThe guidance from the Independent Inquiry advises all organisations to retain any and all documents, notes, emails and all other information, however held, which contains or may contain content pertaining directly or indirectly to the sexual abuse of children or to child protection care, (children relates to any person under the age of 18).\nFor all other information, the following timescales have been agreed by the North West LADO’s.\nContent/Type\nScenario\nTimescale for Review\nAction\nRationale\nContacts, Initial Considerations and Referrals that do not progress\nAll contacts, initial considerations and referrals into LADO where it is clear that there is no evidence to substantiate the allegation.\nReviewed 10 years from the date of closure\nAll information should be deleted or removed, unless at that point the LADO is able to rationalise why the information should be retained.\nA decision to retain information beyond 10 years may be taken by the LADO if patterns or behaviour are emerging that suggest the person could continue to pose a risk of harm.\nMalicious, False or Unfounded\nAll cases that progress to strategy meeting whereby the allegation is found to be Malicious, false or unfounded.\nReviewed after 10 years from the date of closure.\nIf no additional information or evidence is brought to light during this period, the information should be deleted or removed, unless the LADO is able to rationalise why the information should be retained.\nA decision to retain information beyond 10 years may be taken by the LADO if patterns or behaviour are emerging that suggest the person could continue to pose risk of harm.\nUnsubstantiated\nAll cases that progress to strategy meeting whereby the allegation is found to be unsubstantiated.\nNo date for review.\nThese records should be retained until the alleged perpetrator reaches the age of 100 years.  Following this time they should be deleted and destroyed.\nFor cases that are deemed unsubstantiated there is neither evidence to confirm nor deny the alleged incident happened and therefore the risk in deleting this information is too high information sooner.\nThe decision made to retain records whereby the outcome is unsubstantiated comes from the Bichard enquiry regarding Ian Huntley who had a series of unsubstantiated allegations against him that presented a pattern of concern.\nSubstantiated\nAll cases that progress to strategy meeting whereby the outcome is found to be substantiated.\nNo date for review.\nThese records should be retained until the alleged perpetrator reaches the age of 100 years.  Following this time they should be deleted and destroyed.\nSubstantiated case should not be deleted or removed sooner than this time as the outcome suggests the person poses risk of harm to children and the information should remain.\nThis allows for allegations that may be made once the person has died as per Jimmy Saville and Cyril Smith.\nRecording dates for review\nWhen a case is closed by LADO a review date should be recorded 10 years for the date of closure.\nFor cases that are unsubstantiated or substantiated, at the time of the case closure, the date at which the alleged perpetrator turns 100 years old should be recorded as the date of review.\nCases that are reviewed and a rationale is provided to retain information, a new date should be recorded as to when the case should be reviewed again.\nHow will my information be stored?\nInformation is carefully stored on the Liquid Logic (secure management information system within Children’s Social Care) and on Knowsley Borough Council’s secure network. Only authorised professionals have direct access to the information but they may need to share some pieces of information with other agencies in certain circumstances.\nWill my data be transferred abroad?\nNo.\nWill this information be used to make automated decisions about me?\nNo.\nWhat rights do I have when it comes to my data?\nThe right to be informed through this Privacy Notice\nThe right to rectification; you have the right to have personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete\nThe right to complain to the Information Commissioner if you feel we are processing your personal information unlawfully.\nThe right to restrict processing activity in certain circumstances\nThe right to object to certain types of processing activity\nThe right to erasure – you have the right to have personal data erased and to prevent processing however, the right to erasure does not apply in some circumstances\nDue to exemptions under the Data Protection Act 2018, your rights may not apply to information created by the court or that is part of a criminal investigation or proceeding.\nYou have the right under the General Data Protection Regulation to request a copy of your information and to know what it is used for and how it has been shared.

    "text": "Safeguarding means protecting an adult’s right to live in safety, free from abuse and neglect. It is about people and organisations working together to prevent and stop both the risks and experience of abuse or neglect, while at the same time making sure that the adult’s wellbeing is promoted including, where appropriate, having regard to their views, wishes, feelings and beliefs in deciding on any action.\nWho will own my data once I submit it?\nKnowsley Council, Department of Adult Social Care.\nWhy do you need my information?\nA key responsibility for local authorities is the protection of adults with care and support needs to keep them safe from abuse and neglect; this is a requirement of the Care Act 2014. We will use your information for the following purposes:\nTo fulfil our statutory responsibilities in relation to complying with the multi-agency safeguarding adults policy and procedures in line with legislation and government guidance\nTo carry out safeguarding enquiries and other enquiries when there is a concern that an adult may be at risk of abuse or neglect\nProvide you with services and to develop and improve those services\nTo deal with any problems or complaints that arise in relation to a service provided\nInformation will be assessed to determine whether a safeguarding enquiry under Section 42 of the Care Act, or other type of enquiry, is required and in so doing you or your representative will be asked for your wishes and views on how the enquiry should proceed\nDetermine whether it is in the public interest to conduct a safeguarding enquiry even when you may have asked for the enquiry to cease\nWhat allows you to use my information?\nThe Care Act 2014 sets out a legal framework for how local authorities and other parts of the health and care system should protect adults at risk of abuse and neglect.\nIt is good practice to seek consent from individuals before sharing their personal data, though not always practical or realistic in the context of adult safeguarding. Information sharing agreements do not in themselves make the sharing of personal and sensitive data legal or ethical. As we have a statutory basis for processing your personal information we do not need to ask your consent to collect and share it, however, we will do so as a matter of good practice. Where consent is refused we will use your information in line with statutory duties and be assured we will only share relevant information with those who have a need to know.\nWe will share your information in circumstances where:\nthere is a serious risk of harm to you or others\nthere are concerns that an adult is at risk of or is experiencing abuse or neglect\nFor the prevention or detection of a crime\nWhere any legislation requires us to share your information.\nWho will my information be shared with?\nMember organisations of the Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH) including the Police, Children’s Social Care and Housing (KHT).\nInformation may also be shared with the following services when necessary:\nNHS commissioners and providers\nProbation services\nCommunity safety\nOther social care colleagues within Knowsley Council\nOther Local Authority Safeguarding Teams\nIndependent advocacy representing the person who is the subject of a safeguarding concern\nMerseyside Safeguarding Adults Board to enable lessons to be learned when practice standards could be improved\nThe Care Quality Commission\nCare services\nDo I have to provide this information and what will happen if I don’t?\nThere is a Duty of Care to report actual or suspected abuse or neglect of an adult with care and support needs. Information will be shared with consent where possible, respecting the wishes of those who do not consent to share information. However; this can be overridden in the public interest when a judgement on the facts of the case has been made. The Care Act 2014 places a duty on Local Authorities to complete enquiries when there is reasonable suspicion that an adult with care and support needs is at risk of experiencing abuse or neglect.\nFailure to report and complete safeguarding enquiries in relation to safeguarding concerns could mean a person continues to be at risk of abuse and neglect. The person may also not be offered the required support to keep themselves safe.  In addition other people may be at risk of similar treatment by the person or organisation who is the alleged source of the risk. Abuse and neglect can result in significant harm or even death.\nFindings from reviews of serious case have sometimes stated that if professionals or other staff had acted upon their concerns or sought more information, then death or serious harm might have been prevented. (Paragraph 13:46 Care Act Guidance).\nHow long will you keep this data for and why?\nRecords relating to safeguarding adults concerns will be retained for 10 years from date of last contact or eight years from death.\nHow will my information be kept secure?\nThe security of your personal information is important to us. We follow security policies and procedures to control and safeguard access to your personal information.  Documents and information gathered will be stored on your individual record on Knowsley Council’s Liquid logic Adult Social Care system (LAS). Access is limited to those who have a genuine business need.\nAnyone who receives information from us is also under a legal duty to only use the information for the purpose agreed and to keep the information secure and confidential.\nWill my data be transferred overseas and why?\nWe do not usually process your data outside the UK unless covered by an exemption as outlined in the GDPR regulations (19) and requested to do so if it relates to the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against, and prevention of, threats to public security.\nWhat rights do I have when it comes to my data?\nUnder the General Data Protection Regulation, you have the following rights with regard to your personal data:\nThe right to subject access – you have the right to see a copy of the personal data that the council holds about you and find out what it is used for\nThe right to rectification – you have the right to ask the council to correct or remove any inaccurate data that we hold about you\nThe right to erasure (right to be forgotten) you have the right to ask the council to remove data that we hold about you\nThe right to restriction – you have the right to ask for your information to be restricted (locked down) on council systems\nThe right to data portability – you have the right to ask for your data to be transferred back to you or to someone else\nThe right to object – you have the right to ask the council to stop using your personal data or to stop sending you marketing information, or complain about how your data is used\nThe right to prevent automated decision making – you have the right to ask the council to stop using your data to make automated decisions about you or to stop profiling your behaviour (where applicable)\nTo find out more about your rights under the GDPR, please visit the Information Commissioner’s\nwebsite.\nTo request a copy of your data or ask questions about how it is used, please contact:-\nData Protection Officer\nKnowsley Council\nWestmorland Road\nHuyton\nL36 6GA\nOr email:\nInforights@knowsley.gov.uk\nWho can I complain to if I am unhappy about how my data is used?\nYou can complain directly to the council’s Data Protection Team by writing to:-\nData Protection Officer\nKnowsley Council\nWestmorland Road\nHuyton\nL36 6GA\nOr via the\nHave Your Say form.\nYou also have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office using the following details:-\nThe Information Commissioner's Office\nWycliffe House\nWater Lane\nWilmslow\nCheshire\nSK9 5AF\nTelephone: 08456 30 60 60 or 01625 54 57 45\nWebsite:\nwww.ico.org.uk",

This work aims to break this cycle and give women the opportunity to pause and take control of their lives. To do this, Pause undertook a scoping exercise with Knowsley Council to understand which women have repeatedly had children removed from their care. This scoping exercise involved gathering and sharing pseudonymised data about the eligible women and their children. This data was shared with Pause for analysis purposes.\nThe project is now moving into the delivery phase and Knowsley Council will share identifiable information about the eligible women and limited pseudonymised data about their children to enable Pause to prioritise a target group of women to work with. The Pause team will contact the women with information about the programme and participation is voluntary.\nWhat allows you to use my information?\nThe legal basis for sharing this data and information is:\nSection 10 of the Children’s Act 2004.\nSection 2 (5) of the Local Government Act 2000 in order to ‘better assist children who have or are likely to become looked after children and is done on the basis of improving effective service delivery’.\nArticle 9 (1)(h) of the GDPR Health or social care and Data Protection Act 2018, Schedule 1, Part 1 (2) Health and Social Care and Part 2 (18) Safeguarding of children and individuals at risk.\nWho will my information be shared with?\nPause will be provided with information about women who could take part in the programme (and limited information about their children that have been removed). Pause will contact eligible women and find out if they want to take part in the programme. Participation is voluntary. Pause will provide Knowsley Council with anonymised reports on the progress of the work.\nPersonal information will only be shared with Knowsley Council if it is lawful to do so, for example reporting serious incidents or safeguarding concerns.\nHow long will you keep this data for and why?\nAny personal data collected by Pause and shared with Knowsley Council will be retained in line with existing Social Care retention policies, depending on the nature of the data and the reason for sharing.\nHow will my information be stored?\nThe information will be stored securely on Knowsley Council and Pause IT systems.\nWill this information be used to take automated decisions about me?\nNo the information will not be used to take automated decisions.\nWill my data be transferred abroad and why?\nData will only be stored and processed within the UK.\nWhat rights do I have when it comes to my data?\nYou have the right under data protection legislation to request a copy of your information and to know what it is used for and how it has been shared.

The second part of the survey will then help the council assess whether the campaign has had an impact on householders' knowledge of their waste responsibilities and to reduce fly tipping incidents.\nThe data you provide will be used to allow Knowsley Council:\nTo understand key characteristics of householders being surveyed, including age, tenancy status, household types, and employment status\nTo understand whether householders are aware of their duty of care for household waste\nTo provide advice to householders over their waste responsibilities and possible penalties for failure to carry out their duty of care\nTo try and reduce the impact of household waste being fly tipped, therefore reducing the costs associated with the clearing and investigating of household waste crime\nThe survey will request an email address, however this will not be mandatory to complete the survey. The email address will be solely used to allow the council to send the second part of the survey to the recipient, and to enter the recipient into a prize draw or one of three Town Centre Shopping Vouchers.\nThe link to the second part of the survey will also be published via the council’s website and social media.  The survey asks for a partial postcode (first 4 digits) to enable the council to see any trends with a lack of household waste awareness within any areas of the borough.\nThe council will then analyse the survey findings and use the information to understand if householders are fully aware of their waste responsibilities, and to target any areas or sections within the borough with further information if required.\nAnalysis of data will be aggregated and is anonymous.\nWhat allows you to use my information?\nThe legal basis for using your information should you choose to participate is that the council is carrying out a household waste survey as householders have a duty of care to manage their waste, and it is in the public interest for the Council to reduce the incidents of fly tipping within the borough.\nThe responses will allow the council to understand whether the general population of the borough understands their responsibility, and along with the campaign, will provide the information required to try and educate householders on their responsibilities whilst reducing fly tipping at the same time.\nOur lawful basis for doing this is Article 6(1)(e) of the UK General Data Protection Regulations (UK GDPR) – public task.\nWho will my information be shared with?\nOnly Knowsley Council will use the data. It will not be shared with any other third party, although the aggregated and anonymous data may be shared for statistical purposes only with other Government bodies.\nDo I have to provide this information and what will happen if I don’t?\nNo, participation is entirely voluntary and not a legal requirement. You can decide whether or not to complete the survey. If you provide your email address but wish to opt out of entering the prize draw, please email your request to\nenvironmentalhealth@knowsley.gov.uk\nHow long will you keep this data for and why?\nSurvey responses and any email addresses provided will be confidentially destroyed within 6 months following the closure of the household waste survey.\nHow will my information be stored?\nAnonymised electronic survey data including any email addresses provided and subsequently held by the council will be stored on a secure electronic system.\nWill this information be used to take automated decisions about me?\nNo\nWill my data be transferred abroad?\nNo\nWhat rights do I have when it comes to my data?\nCompletion of this survey is voluntary. The survey responses are not requesting “obvious” personal identifiers e.g. names and addresses. It will be very difficult to link survey responses to individuals as only partial post codes are requested, although there is a non-mandatory request for an email address. Where this is the case this would be defined as personal data under the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018.\nWhere you wish to exercise any of your rights under the UK GDPR/DPA the council will need to be able to identify your individual response to comply. If this is possible, you will have the right to:\nRequest information about how your personal data is processed, and to request a copy of that personal data.\nRequest that any inaccuracies in your personal data are rectified without delay.\nRequest that any incomplete personal data are completed, including by means of a supplementary statement.\nRequest that your personal data are erased if there is no longer a justification for them to be processed.\nIn certain circumstances (for example, where accuracy is contested) to request that the processing of your personal data is restricted.\nObject to the processing of your personal data.\nYou have the right under the DPA /UK GDPR to request a copy of your information and to know what it is used for and how it has been shared. This is called the right of subject access.\nTo request a copy of your data or ask questions about how it is used, contact:\nData Protection Officer\nKnowsley Council\nNutgrove Villa\nWestmorland Road\nL36 6GA",

    "text": "Who will own my data once I submit it?\nKnowsley Metropolitan Borough Council\nWhy do you need my information?\nThere are two processing activities for which your personal data may be collected:\nProcessing for law enforcement\nProcessing to protect staff\nOfficers may wear Body Worn Visual (BWV) cameras whilst conducting specific operational tasks such as:\nVisits to retailers / businesses where offences are suspected\nAttendance to locations where crimes are in action or are being reported such as rogue traders targeting the elderly and vulnerable\nTo evidence breaches of legislation and criminal offences identified by front line Environmental Health and Consumer Protection Officers when conducting regulatory enforcement duties consistent with their roles and lawful powers.\nThe cameras are also known to reduce incidents of violence and aggression towards staff and to deter and prevent inappropriate behaviour towards front line enforcement officers of the Environmental Health and Consumer Protection Service.\nTo enable these services to perform their duties, intelligence and data will be collected, stored and processed about individuals and businesses. Information will be collected from complaints, inspections, investigations and service requests.\nWhat allows you to use my information?\nFor some of the functions performed by the Trading Standards, Environmental Health and Licensing Service, we need to use your personal data so we can provide the service or carry out enforcement action.\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data protection Regulation outlines the lawful use of data, which includes statutory and legal obligations.\nThe lawful basis which allows the Council to use your information for this purpose is as follows:\nArticle 6 (1)(e) – processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.\nThe legislation that permits this processing under Article 6(1)(e) includes:\nLocal Government Act 1974\nLocalism Act 2011\nConsumer Rights Act 2015\nConsumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008\nTrademarks Act 1994\nConsumer Protection Act 1987\nAgriculture Act 1970\nFraud Act 2006\nProceeds of Crime Act 2002\nRoad Traffic Act 1988\nChildren & Young Persons Act 1933\nLicensing Act 2003\nGambling Act 2005\nLocal Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976\nLocal Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982\nPublic Health Act 1875\nAnimal Welfare Act 2006 & subservient regulations\nEnvironment Act 1990\nHealth & Safety at Work etc Act 1974\nFood Safety Act 1990, as amended\nFood Safety and Hygiene (England) Regulations 2013\nTrade in Animal and Related Products Regulations 2011\nPublic Health (Control of Disease Act) 1984\nWe will also use your data for the purpose of performing statutory enforcement duties.\nPart 3 of the Data Protection Act 2018 applies to the processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes by competent authorities.\nThe council's Environmental Health and Consumer Protection Service consists of the front-line regulatory services of Environmental Health, Trading Standards and Licensing. As a competent authority, each of these services has a legal power to process personal data for law enforcement purposes. These services have responsibility for regulatory enforcement of statutory and non-statutory functions within their respective remits.\nAny data obtained by the use of the body worn video recording devices by these services will be used for the primary purpose of law enforcement, as defined under section 31 of The Data Protection Act 2018 as:\n“The prevention, investigation detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.’”\nWho will my information be shared with?\nLaw Enforcement Agencies / Partners\nFor example: Merseyside Police, HM Courts, HMRC Customs & Excise, other Local Authority Trading Standards, Licensing or Environmental Health services (as applicable).\nDo I have to provide this information and what will happen if I don’t?\nThe data is required to enable individuals alleged and/or identified as having committed criminal breaches of legislation enforced by the Environmental Health and Consumer Protection Service to be brought to justice via the appropriate applicable regulatory sanction. E.g. Licence Review, Fixed Penalty Notice, Prosecution.\nIf data is not provided, this may not be possible.\nYou have the right to object to the Council using your personal data in certain circumstances, however the Council may not comply with your request if there are strong and legitimate reasons to continue using your data. For more information on your right to object to the use of your data please click\nhere\n.\nHow long will you keep this data for and why?\nData will be retained for a minimum 28 days, in line with the automatic retention schedule built into the body worn camera operating system software.\nThe maximum length of time data will be retained in the event of a non-criminal breach of legislation will be 6 months from the date of capture.\nIf the decision is taken to use the data to evidence a criminal breach of legislation, the data will be retained until the case has been presented to and heard by either Magistrate and/or Crown Court (as applicable), and any appropriate appeal period following conclusion of any Court hearing has lapsed and no further legal procedure is required.\nHow will my information be stored?\nInitially data will be stored as digital media built into the body worn camera device. There are no external memory cards used and the data is encrypted. At the earliest opportunity, the officer will transfer that data from the body worn camera device, to the body worn camera operating system.\nData will be stored in the body worn camera operating system as encrypted digital media, on a secure Council owned and controlled server.\nIf required for evidential / court purposes and where there is a lawful basis to share, a copy of the digital media may be transferred to a hard copy disc in order to comply with any applicable evidential disclosure requirements and/or to facilitate playback in a Courtroom or similar during a hearing.\nAny hard copy disc will be encrypted, and it will be stored in line with the existing secure evidence storage procedure. In the event a hard copy disc needs to be disclosed, every effort will be made to hand deliver the disc, however where that is not possible, a secure courier will be used.\nWill this information be used to take automated decisions about me?\nNo.\nWill my data be transferred abroad?\nNo\nWhat rights do I have when it comes to my data?\nThe subject access rights and the rights to rectification, erasure and restriction do not apply to the processing of ‘relevant personal data’ in the course of a criminal investigation or criminal proceedings.\n‘Relevant personal data’ means personal data contained in a judicial decision or in other documents relating to the investigation or proceedings which are created by or on behalf of a court of other judicial authority.\nAccess to ‘relevant personal data’ is governed by the appropriate legislation covering the disclosure of information in criminal proceedings, such as the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996.\nOutside of the above, you have the right under the Data Protection Act 2018/UK General Data Protection Regulation to request a copy of your information and to know what it is used for and how it has been shared.

Apart from the safety issues, if staff vaccinations were not included then the system would not know that they had been vaccinated and staff already vaccinated would be constantly called and recalled by mail, email, text and phone; in addition, given the pressures on the workplace already responding to the coronavirus pandemic, it is important that managers are aware of the risks that low vaccination rates amongst staff might have as pressures build through the Winter period.\nNIMS already holds PID details such as name and address and vaccination history for the entire population. But because NIMS can only report on critical frontline workers if it knows who they are, it is necessary for relevant organisations to provide information so that individual members can be identified and their employer details can be added to their NIMS record.  The information to be provided should either be NHS numbers of health and care workers or information including name, address, date of birth and sex which allows the NHS number to be derived.  Local organisations will be able to extract this information from the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) or local HR systems.\nWhen employer details have been recorded on NIMS, it will be possible for local health and care organisations to obtain details about the vaccination status of their staff (including whether they have received the vaccination from their GP or local community pharmacy).  If providers submit additional data such as role and location, then NIMS will provide further analysis of the vaccination status for each provider for local use.  NIMS will only make data at a staff member level available to the providers for whom the staff member works.\nYour rights over your information\nUnder data protection law, you have a number of rights over your personal information.

    "text": "Who will own my data once I submit it?\nKnowsley Metropolitan Borough Council\nWhy do you need my information?\nPurpose of collecting this data\nEmployee feedback is essential to ensure we constantly improve our employee offer, identify and act on any challenges, and increase employee engagement. Best practice clearly demonstrates that more engaged employees perform better, have lower absence levels, and are less likely to leave the Council as they feel more valued and trusted so have higher job satisfaction. Therefore, identifying areas to increase engagement throughout the Council will help to improve the councils performance, retention rates, and our employee experience/offer. To better support our employees, having an understanding of their experience overall as well as by various workforce demographics (in an anonymised way) to improve engagement levels and, ultimately, levels of psychological safety and retention across the workforce. This intelligence will form an essential part of our Equality Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) and People Strategy, as well as being common practice amongst other Local Authorities when driving employee engagement.\nTo do all of this we need a mechanism to hear our employees voice and opinions. An employee survey allows us to do this in a quick, easy, and anonymised way.\nWhy we need to collect data, and what will it be used for\nPersonal identifiable data such as name or email is not collected, however, there is a risk that employees may be inadvertently identified if there are low numbers of employees with a protected characteristic within a specific service area.  To mitigate this risk, steps will be taken to ensure access to the raw data is restricted to senior managers within Workforce Development, which will be held on a restricted site.  The data will not filtered by more than one question or published if the responses are less than 10 to ensure the data remains anonymous.\nWe will use questions on a scale from never to always. The topics which will be asked are within the categories below:\nMy work.\nOrganisational values and objectives.\nLeadership.\nMy manager.\nMy wellbeing.\nMy team.\nLearning and development.\nCommunication.\nCelebrating diversity.\nRaising concerns.\nThe data we collect will be answers to these questions. Answers to these questions will allow us to achieve our purpose by:\nAssessing engagement levels across the council.\nIdentifying areas that are working well and where there is a need for improvement\nWe will also collect demographic data by having employees select the option that applies to them. It is voluntary for employees to share this information with us.  Employees can choose to share the following information:\nAge group.\nSex.\nGender identity.\nRace/ ethnicity.\nSexual orientation.\nDisability.\nReligion.\nAre you care experienced/ have you ever spent time in the care system?\nDo you have caring responsibilities?\nEmployees will be encouraged to complete the survey, but they will not be mandated to do so. Employees analysing the data will not be able to see emails or names. Data will only be published if more than 10 responses are in that category (this is in line with best practice and to ensure anonymity).\nIn addition, we may also use your data to support Council recruitment, which means survey feedback/analysed data may be used to support recruitment campaigns and job adverts for roles at Knowsley Council.\nWhat allows you to use my information?\nThe lawful basis for processing the data is:\nArticle 6 (1) (e) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) states that processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.\nArticle 9 (2) (b) of the UK GDPR states that processing is necessary to carry out the obligations and exercise specific rights of the controller or the data subject in the field of employment.\nArticle 9  (2) (g) of the UK GDPR states that processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest.\nThe relevant lawful conditions for processing under the Data Protection Act 2018 are as follows:\nSchedule 1, part 2 (8). Equality of opportunity or treatment.\nSchedule 1, part 1 (1). Employment, social security or social protection.\nThe legislation underpinning this is the Equality Act 2010.  The public sector equality duty is a duty on public authorities to consider, or think about, how their policies or decisions affect people who are protected under the Equality Act. Therefore, as a council, we have a public duty to consider the welfare of employees with protected characteristics. As an organisation it is best practice to collect employee demographics to use for equality and diversity planning. The employee survey will allow all staff, including those with protected characteristics, to share their views. This will strengthen the fulfilment of our duties under this act because it allows us to better understand the experience at work of these employees, both what is working well and what can be improved, and how the experience across the different protected characteristic groups compares to the organisation overall (where there are more than 10 responses).\nWho will my information be shared with?\nData will be analysed by a small human resources team.\nResults will be published for each question, but only If a question has more than 10 responses. All data will be shared anonymously. This data will be shared with all employees and may be used for recruitment/ employer branding purposes through our online channels, such as social media and websites.\nDo I have to provide this information, and what will happen if I don’t?\nThese surveys are voluntary, and there are no consequences of failing to provide demographic data or completing the survey. In the demographic data staff will be asked to share if they wish to complete the survey, there will be an option under each demographic question to put/select ‘prefer not to say’.\nIf staff don’t provide this information, we may not be able to understand the experience of all staff across different demographic groups compared to the organisation overall and, therefore, may not be able to take the action needed to improve this, where needed.  The experience of employees may not improve and, therefore, retention rates may decline, and we may struggle to attract and retain staff.\nHow long will you keep this data for and why?\nPersonal data is kept for no longer than reasonably necessary. Raw data generated from the employee survey will be kept for up to a year after the survey has taken place. The published data will not be personally identifiable as this data will be broken down by a minimum group of 10 people. This allows us sufficient time to re-analyse results if needed to and compare to future surveys. This published/analysed data will be kept indefinitely.\nHow will my information be stored?\nData will be stored on the Council’s secure IT systems and on restricted sites. Surveys submitted in paper form will be input into Microsoft Forms by the HR Team before being placed in confidential waste.\nWill this information be used to take automated decisions about me?\nNo\nWill my data be transferred abroad, and why?\nNo\nWhat rights do I have when it comes to my data?\nUnder the UK  GDPR, you have the following rights with regard to your personal data: -\nThe right to subject access – you have the right to see a copy of the personal data that the council holds about you and find out what it is used for.\nThe right to rectification – you have the right to ask the council to correct or remove any inaccurate data that we hold about you.\nThe right to erasure (right to be forgotten) you have the right to ask the council to remove data that we hold about you.\nThe right to restriction – you have the right to ask for your information to be restricted (locked down) on council systems.\nThe right to data portability – you have the right to ask for your data to be transferred back to you or to a new provider at your request.\nThe right to object – you have the right to ask the council to stop using your personal data or to stop sending you marketing information or complaining about how your data is used.\nThe right to prevent automated decision-making – you have the right to ask the council to stop using your data to make automated decisions about you or to stop profiling your behaviour (where applicable).\nTo find out more about your rights under the DPA 2018/UK GDPR, please\nvisit the Information Commissioner’s website\n.\nTo request a copy of your data or ask questions about how it is used, please\ndownload a copy of our form\nand send it to: -\nData Protection Officer\nKnowsley Council\nNutgrove Villa\nWestmorland Road\nL36 6GA\nOr email:\nInforights@knowsley.gov.uk\nWho can I complain to if I am unhappy about how my data is used?\nYou can complain directly to the Council’s Data Protection Team by writing to: -\nData Protection Officer\nKnowsley Council\nNutgrove Villa\nWestmorland Road\nL36 6GA\nOr email:\ndata.protection.officer@knowsley.gov.uk\nYou also have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office using the following details: -\nThe Information Commissioner's Office\nWycliffe House\nWater Lane\nWilmslow\nCheshire SK9 5AF\nTelephone: 08456 30 60 60 or 01625 54 57 45\nWebsite:\nwww.ico.org.uk",

    "text": "Who will own my data once I submit it?\nKnowsley Metropolitan Borough Council\nWhy do you need my information?\nPurpose of collecting this data\nCollecting employee Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) monitoring data is essential to ensure we understand the makeup of our workforce so we can constantly improve our employee offer whilst tailoring to our staff and ensuring borough-to-workforce representation. Best practice clearly demonstrates that understanding employee demographics allows the council to tailor policies, practices and procedures to suit the needs of employees. Having knowledge of employee demographic data plays a huge part in ensuring the workforce is representative of the borough we serve. The 2021 Census shows us that, as a borough, we are becoming more diverse, it is our responsibility as an employer that we reflect that within our organisation. This intelligence will form an essential part of our EDI and People Strategy, and it will be a common practice amongst other local authorities when striving for workforce-to-borough representation.\nWhy we need to collect data and what will it be used for\nWe need to collect this data for a number of reasons, one being our obligation under The Equality Act 2010.  The public sector equality duty is a duty on public authorities to consider, or think about, how their policies or decisions affect people who are protected under the Equality Act. Therefore, as a council, we have a public duty to consider the welfare of employees with protected characteristics. As an organisation it is best practice to collect employee demographics to use for equality and diversity planning.\nAnother reason of collecting equality data is there is no reliable way of knowing:\nWhether discrimination is taking place\nWhether policies to prevent or tackle discrimination are working; and\nWhen we should amend policy or practice to cater for social change\nInformation from equality monitoring will help us to ensure fair access to employment and services. Monitoring can also help us find out why and how discrimination takes place.\nIn essence, employee’s equality data will be used to shape policies, procedures and practices with the sole aim of creating a more inclusive and diverse workforce.\nOn HCM, there is always an option for employees to click ‘prefer not to say’. The problem we are encountering currently is that there are a high number of ‘unknowns’, this means that the field has simply not been ticked at all. The main aim of this data campaign is to reduce the number of unknowns, so we have a clearer idea of the demographic of our workforce. This is already reported on annually in the workforce monitoring report.\nTo encourage staff to fill in their data, employees will be entered into a prize draw. If employees do not enter their data, they will not be entered into the draw. The prize is to win a £10 voucher to be used in Knowsley. There will be 3 names drawn.\nWhat Personal Information do we collect?\nAs a Local Authority, we have a legal obligation under the Equality Act 2010 to monitor customers and staff on their:\nAge\nDisability\nEthnicity (Race)\nReligion, Belief or non-belief\nGender (Sex)\nGender Identity\nSexual Orientation\nWe also ask employees to let us know their carer’s status and whether or not they have served in the armed forces.\nWhat allows you to use my information?\nThe lawful basis for processing the data is:\nArticle 6 (1) (e) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) states that processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.\nArticle 9 (2) (b) of the UK GDPR which states that processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or the data subject in the field of employment.\nArticle 9  (2) (g) of the UK GDPR which states that processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest.\nThe relevant lawful conditions for processing under the Data Protection Act 2018 are as follows:\nSchedule 1, part 2 (8). Equality of opportunity or treatment.\nSchedule 1, part 1 (1). Employment, social security or social protection.\nThe legislation underpinning this is the Equality Act 2010.  The public sector equality duty is a duty on public authorities to consider, or think about, how their policies or decisions affect people who are protected under the Equality Act. Therefore, as a council, we have a public duty to consider the welfare of employees with protected characteristics. As an organisation it is best practice to collect employee demographics to use for equality and diversity planning. The employee survey will allow all staff, including those with protected characteristics, to share their views. This will strengthen the fulfilment of our duties under this act because it allows us to better understand the experience at work of these employees, both what is working well and what can be improved, and how the experience across the different protected characteristic groups compares to the organisation overall (where there are more than ten responses)\nWho will my information be shared with?\nAll data imputed to HCM (Oracle) will only be accessible by HR professionals or employees via their own accounts.\nA small team of human resources staff will analyse the data. They will then draw a report and save it in a secure folder only accessible by HR professionals.\nDo I have to provide this information and what will happen if I don’t?\nFilling out employees' information is entirely voluntary.\nIf employees do not enter their data, they will not be entered into the draw.\nIf employees do not wish to be entered into the prize draw, they can contact\nOrganisational.DevlopmentTeam@knowsley.gov.uk\nand their name will not be included in the draw.\nThe prize is to win a £10 voucher to be used in Knowsley. There will be three names drawn.\nEmployees can complete the survey by choosing ‘prefer not to say’ however if no response is provided then they will not be entered into the prize draw.\nHow long will you keep this data for and why?\nPersonal data will be kept on the HR system (HCM) for as long as they are employed by us, and after they have left.\nPrize draw data will be deleted when the prize draw is complete?\nHow will my information be stored?\nData will be stored on the Council’s secure HCM systems.\nData from the report will be stored on a secure SharePoint site that is only accessible to HR professionals.\nWill this information be used to take automated decisions about me?\nNo\nWill my data be transferred abroad and why?\nNo\nWhat rights do I have when it comes to my data?\nUnder the UK  GDPR, you have the following rights with regard to your personal data:\nThe right to subject access – you have the right to see a copy of the personal data that the council holds about you and find out what it is used for.\nThe right to rectification – you have the right to ask the council to correct or remove any inaccurate data that we hold about you.\nThe right to erasure (right to be forgotten) you have the right to ask the council to remove data that we hold about you.\nThe right to restriction – you have the right to ask for your information to be restricted (locked down) on council systems.\nThe right to data portability – you have the right to ask for your data to be transferred back to you or to a new provider at your request.\nThe right to object – you have the right to ask the council to stop using your personal data or to stop sending you marketing information or complain about how your data is used.\nThe right to prevent automated decision-making – you have the right to ask the council to stop using your data to make automated decisions about you or to stop profiling your behaviour (where applicable).\nTo find out more about your rights under the DPA 2018/UK GDPR, please\nvisit the Information Commissioner’s website\n.\nTo request a copy of your data or ask questions about how it is used, please\ndownload a copy of our form\nand send it to:\nData Protection Officer\nKnowsley Council\nNutgrove Villa\nWestmorland Road\nHuyton\nL36 6GA\nOr email:\nInforights@knowsley.gov.uk\nWho can I complain to if I am unhappy about how my data is used?\nYou can complain directly to the Council’s Data Protection Team by writing to:\nData Protection Officer\nKnowsley Council\nNutgrove Villa\nWestmorland Road\nHuyton\nL36 6GA\nOr email:\ndata.protection.officer@knowsley.gov.uk\nYou also have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office using the following details:\nThe Information Commissioner's Office\nWycliffe House\nWater Lane\nWilmslow\nCheshire\nSK9 5AF\nTelephone: 08456 30 60 60 or 01625 54 57 45\nWebsite:\nwww.ico.org.uk",

The information will be required as part of implementing this procedure. In addition, members of the public are permitted to speak at certain public meetings of the Council. The information requested in this respect is to facilitate this process.\nWhat Personal Information do we collect?\nFor Knowsley Council to implement its security procedure, we may collect all or some of the following information from you:\nPersonal details (i.e. your name).\nContact details (e.g. home address, phone number, email address).\nWhat allows you to use my information?\nWe are required to collect and process data to fulfil official public tasks as a public authority, as part of the Council’s statutory obligations to provide certain services.  This is provided within Article 6 (1)(e) of the UK GDPR by virtue of the following:\nIt has been held in case law (i.e. Laporte v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis) that s100A of the Local Government Act 1972 permits exclusion from Council public meetings so long as the justifiable purpose is to suppress or prevent disorderly conduct or other misbehaviour at a meeting, and this is not limited to the meeting room itself.  The Council’s security procedure, contained within the\nPolicy Statement Regarding Behaviour and Conduct\n, has been developed to support the health and safety of all attending and mitigate against disruption (which, in accordance with the Public Meeting Act 1908, is in and of itself, a crime).\nMembers of the public are also requested to provide their name, address and contact details where they are requesting to speak at particular public meetings.  An individual has the right to withdraw their consent to provide this information, but this would mean that they would not be permitted to speak (and they would still be required to provide their name if they wished to attend the meeting in person in accordance with the Council’s security procedure as permitted by the Local Government Act 1972 (as amended) referenced above).\nWho will my information be shared with?\nYour information may be shared with the Council’s security provider/personnel and law enforcement agencies where it is lawful to do so.\nIn respect of speaking at the Planning Committee, with your permission, your contact details may also be shared with other members of the public wishing to make representations in respect of a planning application.\nDo I have to provide this information and what will happen if I don’t?\nAs part of the Council’s security procedure, you will be required to show photographic identification, and to sign in (i.e. provide your name), in order to gain access to a Council building to attend a public meeting.  The Council will only view photographic identification and will not take or retain a copy of the information.\nShould you choose not to provide this information, you will not be permitted to enter the building but will still be able to watch the meeting as it will be live streamed\nhere\n.\nSimilarly, members of the public are requested to provide their name, address and contact details where they are requesting to speak at particular public meetings.  An individual has the right to refuse to provide this information, but this would mean that they would not be permitted to speak at the relevant meeting (although subjected to comply with the Council’s security procedure as set out above, they would still be permitted to attend and observe the proceedings).\nHow long will you keep this data for and why?\nYour information will ordinarily be retained for a maximum period of 31 days after the meeting. However, it may be retained for a longer period if required due to health and safety and/or law enforcement purposes, or for example, where a meeting has been adjourned.  It will not be retained for longer than is necessary for the purpose and in accordance with KMBC retention policies.  In addition, if you have registered to speak at a meeting, your name may be reflected within the formal minutes of the meeting, which are retained for a minimum of 6 years but may be retained longer based on business need.\nHow will my information be stored?\nInformation may be saved manually and electronically (i.e. through emails).\nWhere your information is stored electronically this will be on the Council’s secure network.

This information is required to ensure guests are supported appropriately.\nIf you are a sponsor, we will receive the information you provide in your application form and any additional information you provide when we discuss your application with you.\nWhy do you need my information?\nYour information is needed as part of the Council’s requirement to deliver the Homes for Ukraine Scheme in Knowsley. The information collected allows the Council to co-ordinate appropriate support to sponsors/hosts and guests of the scheme.\nYou will be allocated a worker from the Council’s Resettlement team to support you under the Scheme and we will keep a record of this.\nWhat allows you to use my information?\nThe lawful basis for sharing your information with Government and other Council and commissioned services is UK GDPR Article 6(1)(e) - the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Controller. The Council needs to share some information such as name, date of birth and address, in order to deliver the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme.\nWhere information is sensitive in nature (special category data) we will only share it under the additional condition of UK GDPR Article 9(2)(a) explicit consent or on the basis of Article 9(2)(g) substantial public interest and under Schedule 1 Part 2 (18) of the Data Protection Act 2018 for safeguarding of children and individuals at risk in acknowledgment of the guests’ vulnerability in seeking refuge from the war in Ukraine. The Council may need to share additional information to help you to access the range of support/services you require such as information on health, mental health, alleged or committed offences.\nSome of your information may be used for safeguarding purposes.\nThe following pieces of legislation provide the Council with the Powers to perform public tasks:\nImmigration and Asylum Act 1999\nWelfare Reform and Work Act 2016\nChildren and Families Act 2014\nChildren and Social Work Act 2017\nChildren Act 1989\nSafeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act\nHealth and Social Care Act 2012\nTo share your information other than that necessary to deliver the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship scheme, we will seek your consent under Article 6 (1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) of the UK GDPR. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Details on how you can withdraw your consent are provided below.\nHowever, please be aware that your consent is not required where the Council consider processing is necessary under Article 6(1)(e) and Article 9(2)(g) for safeguarding purposes.\nWe will never share your personal information for commercial gain or marketing.\nWho will my information be shared with?\nWhen we share your personal information, we will only do so where it is necessary and required by law, or you have given your consent.\nThe types of organisations we may share your information with include Home Office, DLUHC, Department for Works and Pensions, Education partners, Housing agencies, English for Speakers of other Languages (ESOL) providers, Employment agencies, Health partners, Substance misuse agencies, Community partners and Law enforcement agencies.\nShould you move to a different Local Authority we will share your information with the Local Authority you are moving to so that support may be transferred under the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme.\nDo I have to provide this information and what will happen if I don’t?\nThe UK government is working in partnership with Local Authorities to deliver the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme. Knowsley Council checks the suitability of sponsors and hosts in its locality in terms of their offending history (DBS check), any safeguarding concerns, and the suitability of the accommodation they are providing. The Council’s Resettlement team also allocates a worker to the guest on arrival and checks for any safeguarding concerns and what necessary support they require. The guest is requested to sign a consent form to share any additional information necessary to deliver the support. If the sponsor/guest or host/guest relationship breaks down, the Council may support the guest to find alternative accommodation.\nShould the guest withdraw consent to share information with the Resettlement team, it will be very difficult for the Council to provide support under the scheme. However, a guest can opt out at any time by sending an email to\nRefugee.Resettlement@knowsley.gov.uk\nHow long will you keep this data for and why?\nIt is not known how long the war in Ukraine will last, but the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme provides guests with a visa to remain in the UK for 3 years. It also provides thank you payments to sponsors/hosts for up to 2 years, based on the length of time the guest has been in the UK. Knowsley Council expects to retain the data for up to 2 years, or as long as the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme continues to operate if this is longer. The 2-year retention period will initiate at the point the Scheme ends, after which point the information will be deleted from our systems. Financial information will be retained for 6 years and confidentially destroyed.\nHow will my information be stored?\nThe information will be stored on the Council’s secure IT systems with access to your information being restricted to only those staff who need to see it as part of their job role. Information shared with DLUHC will be via the Foundry secure portal.\nPersonal information shared with partner agencies will be sent using encrypted email systems, such as through the TLS secured domain list or by Egress secure mail.\nWill this information be used to make automated decisions about me?\nNo. Decisions will be made by officers of the Council taking account of the information available.\nWill my data be transferred abroad and why?\nNo. Information will be kept on Council servers including Microsoft cloud servers which are hosted in the UK.\nWhat rights do I have when it comes to my data?\nUnder the Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018/ UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), you have the following rights with regard to your personal data: -\nThe right to subject access – you have the right to see a copy of the personal data that the council holds about you and find out what it is used for\nThe right to rectification – you have the right to ask the council to correct or remove any inaccurate data that we hold about you\nThe right to erasure (right to be forgotten) you have the right to ask the council to remove data that we hold about you.

We want you to be confident that your information is kept safe, secure and for you to understand how and why we use it. It sets out how Knowsley Council will use data collected from respondents.\nYou can decide whether to complete the survey or participate.

It is used to inform NHS England and local providers about the sufficiency of pharmacy provision in a local area. The information gathered in the survey adds to the understanding of the sufficiency of pharmacy provision across small local areas to allow for producing assessments of the health and care needs of the population, in particular to support the statutory responsibilities of the:\nPharmaceutical Needs Assessment\nJoint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA)\nDirector of Public Health’s Annual report\nIdentifying priorities for action\nInforming decisions on (for example) the design and commissioning of services\nTo assess the performance of the local health and care system and to evaluate and develop them\nTo report summary statistics to national organisations (NHS England) and the Cheshire and Merseyside ICB. This will be headline, aggregated data and identifiable data will not be shared.\nUndertaking equity analysis of trends, particularly for vulnerable groups.\nIn these cases, the information is used in such a way that individuals cannot be identified from them and personal identifiable details are removed as soon as is possible in the processing of intelligence on an aggregated level.\nWhat type of information will you be processing?\nWhen completing the survey, we may process parts of your personal data. The survey may appear to be anonymous as we will NOT be asking for any specific personal details that would directly identify you, for example, your name, date of birth, full address. However, we may be able to identify you through the collective answers you provide indirectly on the survey, and we are required to make you aware of this.\nWe ask optional questions for equalities monitoring, including:\nAge group\nGender\nCarer Status\nDisability\nWe also ask identifiable questions that include:\nPostcode\nDisability including Cancer, Diabetes or HIV\nHealth Condition including impairments\nEthnic Group\nReligion\nSexual Orientation\nIn almost all instances you have a “Prefer not to say option”\nYour participation is entirely optional, by participating you are consenting to the information provided being used for the purposes stated.\nWhat allows you to use my information?\nCompleting the survey is a voluntary act on your part to help us understand sufficiency of pharmacy provision.\nBy completing the survey, you are giving your consent for the data you give to be used.\nThe legal bases which allows the Council to lawfully process your data fall under the UK General Data Protection Regulation.\nArticle 6(1) (a) Consent “the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose”.\nBy choosing to complete the survey, you give Knowsley Council consent to process the data you provide. As previously mentioned, this data will in the main be anonymous and due to this reason, it is unlikely you would be able to withdraw your consent once entered.\nArticle 6(1) (e) Public task “processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law.” As outlined in the\nLevelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023.\nWho will my information be shared with?\nAggregated and anonymous data gathered from this survey will be used by Knowsley Council in the final Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment, which will be published online. The final document will not contain any personal or identifiable data at any level.\nDo I have to provide this information and what will happen if I don’t?\nNo, participation is entirely voluntary and not a legal requirement. You can decide whether to participate or not, and you can decide how much or how little you wish to participate. There is a ‘prefer not to say’ option available.\nHow long will you keep this data for and why?\nThe Survey will be active for one month Liverpool Council will maintain the survey until 31st December to accommodate all Local Authorities in Cheshire and Merseyside.
