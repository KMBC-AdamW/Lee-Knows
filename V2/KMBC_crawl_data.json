    "text": "Public Health\nPublic health aims to help residents live healthier and happier lives and focuses on preventing people from getting ill in the first place.  Health is not only about general practice and hospital services; it is influenced by the environment we live in, our housing, our employment and educational attainment, and our access to transport. All of these factors impact our health and well-being throughout our lives.\nPublic Health is a statutory responsibility of the Local Authority. Knowsley’s Public Health team ensures that health and well-being are at the heart of everything the Council does. They also work closely with partners across the borough to influence them to do the same. This includes working in partnership with local partner organisations, the community and voluntary sector and businesses.  The team also works with local GPs, dentists and hospitals to help them identify, prioritise, and address health needs. Support is also provided to vulnerable settings and groups to help ensure residents are protected from infectious diseases, incidents and outbreaks.\nPublic Health services are commissioned by the Council and delivered by various organisations to provide preventative, treatment and support services and initiatives for residents.\nPublic Health recognises that maintaining good health can make considerable positive differences to people throughout their lives.   This includes encouraging self-care and positive lifestyles and promoting and encouraging the uptake of cancer screening programmes and vaccinations. This involves working across a whole range of areas over the course of people’s lives.\nClick on the links below to find out more about some of our services:\n0 to 25 years Health and Wellbeing service\nSexual health services\nNHS Health Checks programme for those aged 40 to 74 years\nStop smoking service\nSubstance misuse and alcohol service\nHealthy Knowsley service\nStart well\nFamilies are encouraged to make healthy choices for themselves and their baby before conception and through pregnancy and birth.\nGrow well\nChildren and young people are encouraged to achieve well in school, build resilience to help them cope with life’s challenges and make a positive, healthy journey into adulthood.\nLive well\nA good work-life balance is key to our personal health and wellbeing. Local people are supported into good quality jobs and encouraged to make positive lifestyle choices that reduce the risks to their health, such as alcohol and drug use, smoking, obesity, and sexual health issues.\nAge well\nWith the right choices and support, more people will live healthier lives and stay independent for longer. People with long-term illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease have the best possible quality of life and can make choices about their care.",

This guide will help you when applying for in-year admission to Knowsley schools.\nYou may want an in-year admission to a Knowsley school because:\nYou are moving your address into the area, and your child cannot continue attending school due to travel distance/time.\nYour child is currently in an independent (private) school, or you have elected to home-educate, but you now want your child to attend a Knowsley school.\nOther reasons why you no longer want your child to continue to attend their current school.\nPlease note:\nThere is no guarantee that a place will be available in your school/s of preference or that siblings will be offered places in the same school.\nIf your child has an Education Health and Care Plan (EHCP), you should contact your local authority's Special Education Needs Service about changing schools, as different procedures apply.\nYou should receive an outcome to your application within 15 school days. In-year applications are not processed during school holiday periods when schools are closed. Please remember this when applying or making enquiries about an outcome.\nTo apply for a school outside Knowsley, you will need to follow the in-year admission procedures of that local authority.",

    "text": "Overview\nIf your child has been refused a place at a school this is because there is no place available and the admission authority of the school believe that, to admit another child, would impact on education – this is known as creating prejudice to the provision of efficient education and the efficient use of resources in the school.\nApplicants have a right to appeal against the refusal of a school place. For example, if they feel that there are reasons why their child should be offered a place in a particular school that have not previously been considered, or, if they feel the admission authority of the school has not correctly applied their admission arrangements and their child has been disadvantaged in securing a place because of this.\nThe appeal panel can either turn down the appeal, or they can decide that the school admission authority should make an exceptional place available.\nThe panel of people (usually three) who make the decision are independent and have no direct involvement with the school. The appeal is supported by a neutral Clerk who makes sure the appeal hearing is conducted correctly and who can provide guidance about national admission appeal legislation. The clerk confirms the outcome of the appeal to parents after the hearing has finished.",

This has provided us with a statutory definition of domestic abuse, emphasising that it is not just physical violence, but can also be emotional, controlling or coercive, and economic abuse.\nIn addition, the Act:\nExtends the controlling or coercive behaviour offence to cover post-separation abuse.\nA child who sees, hears, or experiences the effects of domestic abuse and is related to the person being abused or the abuser, will also to be regarded as a victim of domestic abuse in their own right.\nExtends the offence of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress (known as the “revenge porn” offence) to cover threats to disclose such material.\nCreates a new offence of non-fatal strangulation or suffocation of another person.\nEnables domestic abuse offenders to be subject to polygraph testing as a condition of their licence following their release from custody.\nPlaces the guidance supporting the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (“Clare’s law”) on a statutory footing.\nProvides that all eligible homeless victims of domestic abuse automatically have ‘priority need’ for homelessness assistance.\nExtends the controlling or coercive behaviour offence to cover post-separation abuse.\nA child who sees, hears, or experiences the effects of domestic abuse and is related to the person being abused or the abuser, will also to be regarded as a victim of domestic abuse in their own right.\nExtends the offence of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress (known as the “revenge porn” offence) to cover threats to disclose such material.\nCreates a new offence of non-fatal strangulation or suffocation of another person.\nEnables domestic abuse offenders to be subject to polygraph testing as a condition of their licence following their release from custody.\nPlaces the guidance supporting the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (“Clare’s law”) on a statutory footing.\nProvides that all eligible homeless victims of domestic abuse automatically have ‘priority need’ for homelessness assistance.\nRead more on the Domestic Abuse Act, 2021 and its full reach",

Self-neglect can be a complex and difficult issue to deal with because it is important to respect the person's right to make their own choices, but it is also important to protect their health and well-being.\nThe Mental Capacity Act 2005 is a law that helps to decide what action can be taken in cases of self-neglect.\nHere are some signs of self-neglect\nPoor personal hygiene, such as not bathing or changing clothes regularly\nNot eating or drinking enough\nNot taking medication as prescribed\nLiving in a dirty or cluttered environment\nHoarding animals or objects\nIt is important to remember that self-neglect is a serious issue, but it is one that can be helped.

You should expect to pay towards the cost of support services unless your assets, savings and income are very low.\nA social care assessment is the way we decide if you have needs that we can support you with. This is called being eligible for care and support.\nDuring the assessment we will have a conversation with you about what things you can do for yourself, what is important to you and  what you want to achieve.\nWe will share information with you before the assessment about the eligibility criteria for care and support, and we will share the outcome of the assessment with you too.\nWe know from talking to our residents that people want to live independently, in their own homes, for as long as possible.\nOur approach\nIn Adult Social Care, our approach is focused on early intervention and prevention. We aim to support people to promote their wellbeing and enable them to be as independent as possible.\nThis support can include:\nproviding information and advice in a format that you would prefer\nreferrals to community-based support services such as community centres or services that can help you with tasks like shopping and cleaning\nproviding a high level of support for a short period of time, for example to help you recover after a period of illness or injury\nproviding you with equipment or technology enabled care tools, such as pendant alarms or medication dispensers, to help you remain independent in your own home\nproviding support and services in your own home including help with your personal care needs\nYou will often find that the support you need can be provided by your family or friends, but there is also lots of support available in your community to help you when you need it. You can\nsearch the Live Well Directory\nto find out what is going on in your area. You can also call Healthy Knowsley on 0800 0731 202 for advice and information to improve your health and wellbeing.\nIf you need more specialist care and support, we will complete a social care assessment with you to help us understand what care and support you need.\nIf you are concerned that you or somebody you know is at risk of abuse or neglect, please contact us on 0151 443 2600 to make a safeguarding referral.",

It also provides guidance on how others can make decisions on behalf of someone who lacks mental capacity. Any decisions made for someone who lacks mental capacity must be made in their best interest.\nSince April 2009, the Mental Capacity Act has also provided a legal framework to ensure that people who lack capacity who are being deprived of their liberty are being done so lawfully. This means that the deprivation of liberty must be authorised in accordance with the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).\nDoLS applies to people who are resident in a care or nursing home or hospital.

    "text": "Introduction\nSince 2010, the council has received less money from the government. Because of this, we need to make sure we are using our land and buildings in the best way possible.\nWe need to simplify our property portfolio and sell off land and buildings that are not very useful to us. This means that we can use and invest in our remaining buildings more effectively to make sure they help us provide services to the community.\nThe council's property portfolio can be divided into two categories:\nAssets that help us provide services directly\nAssets that make money and also help the community\nIn some cases, assets may not provide enough financial or other benefits any more. In these cases, community asset transfer may be an option to bring social and other benefits to the community.\nAs a council that believes in cooperation, we believe that community asset transfer can, in some cases, give local people and organisations more control over the future of their community. This guidance recognises the potential benefits of asset transfer for the community, the organisation proposing the transfer, and the council.\nChanging ownership or management of an asset can potentially extend its use, making it more valuable to the community. It may also attract additional resources to an area and empower local residents by raising aspirations and a sense of belonging. In this way, community asset transfer can strengthen the local economy, environment, and community/voluntary sector.\nHowever, the council recognises that community asset transfer may not always be the best way forward. There may be other outcomes or priorities that are more important.\nThis guide provides a structured way to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of community asset transfer to ensure an informed decision.",

Instead you will be based in the community, with care provided from the Shared Lives carer’s own home.\nSometimes you will live in your carer’s home for short periods of a few days, or one or two weeks. Or you might live with your carer for a longer period of time – months or even years.\nYou will also meet and get to know your carer first, before starting any Shared Lives arrangement. We always make sure you are happy with your carer first!\nIn most cases you will be supported individually by your carer. However they might also live with other family members, who you will get to know and spend time with.\nIn Shared Lives we put you at the very centre, and together we plan services with you that help you develop your skills and lifestyle.

Aids must be provided free of charge whether provided to meet or prevent/delay needs.

The team will also provide advice and information on benefits you might be able to get to help with your living costs.\nYour support will start when you need it. The financial assessment may take place after the support begins. You will be expected to pay from the day your care and support starts.

We also need to see proof of any stocks, unit trusts, shares, national savings or any other savings or investments that you have.\nIncome and benefits. We need to see five consecutive wage slips if you are paid weekly, or two if you are paid monthly. If you have just started work, do not wait until you have these before claiming benefits. You can send us your first wage slip or ask your employer for a letter confirming what your wage will be. We can estimate your entitlement and revise the calculation when your payslips are available. If you can't find your payslips, ask us for a certificate of earnings to send to your employer.\nWe may need to see proof of any benefits you receive. This could include child benefits or tax credits. If we can, we will confirm the details with the Department for Work and Pensions, but we may need you to provide proof if we cannot confirm the amount that you receive.\nWe need to see proof of any other income that you receive and the income of anyone else who lives with you, for example, a relative or friend. If you need advice, please contact us for advice on 0151 443 4042.\nIf you need to provide any supporting documents, you can\nupload your evidence online\nor using the self-service stations in our libraries.\nPlease do not send valuable documents through the post.\nIf you cannot provide the information, please get in touch with us. You mustn't delay in returning your claim for benefit.",

But for the second part, when you are presenting the case for your child, no other parents who are appealing would be present.\nAfter the panel have heard all appeals, they take decisions in private, with only the Clerk present, so you will not usually find out the outcome of your appeal on the day. The appeal Clerk will send a letter confirming the outcome within 5 working days wherever possible, but if there have been several appeals for a school heard over a number of days, it may take a little longer.\nThe annual appeal timetable can be found\nhere\n.",

You can usually do this by calling or emailing the school office.\nAsk for permission in advance for planned absences\nIf you need to take your child out of school for a special occasion, such as a wedding or holiday, be sure to ask the school for permission well in advance.\nTake an interest in your child's school work\nTalk to your child about their day at school, and help them with their homework assignments. This shows your child that you value their education and are there to support them.\nIf you have any concerns about your child's school attendance, please talk to their teacher or welfare team.

It’s a great way to contribute to your local community, make a difference and improve the life chances of all children to ensure they have the very best educational opportunities.\nWhat will I be expected to do as a local authority governor\nSchool governors provide strategic leadership and accountability in schools. Governors appoint the headteacher and deputy headteacher.  It is governors who hold the main responsibility for finance in schools, and it is governors who work with the headteacher to make the tough decisions about balancing resources.\nEach individual governor is a member of a governing board, which is established in law as a corporate body. Individual governors may not act independently of the rest of the governing board. Decisions are the joint responsibility of the governing board.\nThe role of the governing board is a strategic one, it has three core responsibilities\nEnsuring clarity of vision, ethos and strategic direction.\nHolding the headteacher to account for the educational performance of the school and its pupils; and\nOverseeing the financial performance of the school and making sure its money is well spent.\nIn order to achieve these responsibilities, the Governing Board works with the school on planning and developing polices and keeping the school under review. Its powers and responsibilities must be exercised in partnership with the Headteacher and staff.\nEffective governance is based on six key features\nStrategic leadership that sets and champions vision, ethos and strategy.\nAccountability that drives up educational standards and financial performance.\nPeople with the right skills, experience, qualities and capacity.\nStructures that reinforce clearly defined roles and responsibilities.\nCompliance with statutory and contractual requirements.\nEvaluation to monitor and improve the quality and impact of governance.\nThe headteacher is responsible for the internal organisation, management and control of the school and the implementation of the strategic framework established by the governing body.\nThere are different types of school governors that sit on a governing board.",

It allows the police to ban a perpetrator from returning to a specific residence and from having contact with the victim for up to 28 days. This gives the victim time to consider their options and get the support they need.\nDVPOs are often used when there is not enough evidence to charge the perpetrator with a criminal offence, or when the victim does not want to press charges. They can also be used in addition to criminal charges.\nHow to apply for a DVPO\nIf you are a victim of domestic violence, you can apply for a DVPO by contacting the police. They will assess your situation and decide whether a DVPO is necessary. If it is, they will help you to apply for one.\nWhat happens if a DVPO is granted?\nIf a DVPO is granted, the perpetrator will be served with a notice. This notice will tell them what they are not allowed to do, such as returning to the specific residence or having contact with the victim. If the perpetrator breaches the DVPO, they could be arrested and charged with a criminal offence.",

    "text": "Multi-agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC)\nA MARAC is a meeting of professionals from different agencies who work together to protect victims of domestic abuse who are at high risk of harm. The MARAC will share information about the victim's case and develop a plan to keep them safe.\nSupport for victims is usually provided by an Independent Domestic Violence Advocate (IDVA), who is a specialist advisor who has received training to work with high-risk victims of domestic abuse. The IDVA will help the victim to access the support they need and to develop a safety plan.\nThe MARAC will also work to reduce the risk of further harm to the victim and their family members. This may involve things like putting the perpetrator in touch with a domestic abuse perpetrator program or helping the victim to find a safe place to live.\nWho can be referred to a MARAC?\nAny victim of domestic abuse who is at high risk of harm can be referred to a MARAC. This includes victims who have been physically abused, threatened, or harassed. It also includes victims who are experiencing coercive control, which is a pattern of behaviour designed to control and dominate.\nHow to contact the Knowsley MARAC Team\nIf you are concerned that someone you know may be at high risk of domestic abuse, you can\nemail\nthe Knowsley MARAC Team.\nIf you are at immediate risk, contact the Police on 999.\nRead more about Domestic Abuse\nhere\n.",

Scammers often make false promises to trick you into giving them money.\nCommon types of scams\nFake lotteries and prize draws\nScammers may send you an email or letter telling you that you have won a lottery or prize draw. However, there is no such lottery or prize draw, and the scammers are simply trying to trick you into sending them money.\nClairvoyants\nClairvoyants are people who claim to be able to see the future.

You can also nominate a Power of Attorney to help you with your finances if you need it.\nMonitor bills and bank statements.\nIf bills are left unpaid or large sums of money have come out of your account, this could be a sign of financial abuse.\nBe careful with cash.\nDon't keep large amounts of cash in your home, as this could make you a target for theft.\nBe aware of scams.\nScammers often target older people and people with disabilities. Be wary of unsolicited phone calls, emails, and letters. Never give out your personal or financial information to someone you don't know and trust.\nSeek financial advice.\nIf you are unsure about how to manage your finances, seek advice from a financial advisor. Your bank manager can also help you to identify any extra support that may be available to you.\nStay safe online.\nEnsure you have strong passwords and be suspicious of any links or emails you don't recognise.\nStay connected to your community.\nSocial isolation can put people more at risk of financial abuse. Make sure to stay in touch with your loved ones and participate in community activities.\nSet up a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA).\nThis enables you to choose someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf about things such as paying bills and collecting income if you become unable to do so yourself.\nDisplay a 'no cold callers' sign.\nThis can help to deter scammers from knocking on your door.\nStop junk mail and unwanted telephone calls.\nThere are several ways to do this, such as signing up for the Mailing Preference Service and Telephone Preference Service.\nRun background checks on caregivers or personal assistants.\nAnyone entering your home or has personal contact with you should be accounted for and trustworthy.\nProtect your valuables.\nList and photograph all of your valuables and keep the items in a locked drawer and the photographs in a different location.",

If you own the property that you live in, it will only be considered if you no longer live there as your main home, for example, if you move into a care home to meet your needs.\nYour support will start when you need it. Your financial assessment may take place after the support begins.  You will be expected to pay from the day your support starts. Therefore, you may receive an initial bill where charges have been applied and backdated to the date your support started.\nIf you are having difficulty paying your bills, please tell us as soon as possible. We may be able to offer you information or advice which could prevent you getting behind with your bills or falling into debt.

The pendant works both inside and outside your home.\nWhat happens when you press the button\nTo use a lifeline alarm, simply press the button on the alarm unit or pendant. This will send a signal to the alarm monitoring centre, where a trained operator will answer your call and assess the situation. The operator can then call for help, such as an ambulance or the fire department, or they can contact your family or friends.\nLifeline alarms are a great way to stay safe and independent, especially if you live alone or have health problems. They can give you peace of mind knowing that help is always just a button press away.",

This approach aims to join up support across education, health, and care.\nFrom September 2014, children and young people assessed as needing an EHC plan will have the option of a personal budget. This means that money from education, health, and social care can be brought together into a single budget.\nNot all children will be eligible for a personal budget. To find out if your child is eligible, please consult with your health or care representative.\nFind out more about the SEND reforms in Knowsley\nhere.",

The delay in moving in must be for one of the following reasons:\nTo adapt the house if you or a member of your family have a disability.\nYou are waiting for a social fund payment to meet a need arising from the move or in connection with setting up the home; a family member must be aged five or under, or your applicable amount includes one of the following premiums: pensioner, enhanced pensioner, higher pensioner, disability, severe disability or disable child premium.\nYou became liable to make payments regarding the property while you were in hospital or a residential home.\nHowever, even when the conditions are met for two or three above, we cannot pay the benefit if you had to pay rent on a previous property immediately before the start of the tenancy at your new address. To qualify, you must apply to the council within four weeks of moving into your new home.\nSlightly different criteria apply if you are a victim of domestic violence.\nThe rules about rent before occupation are complicated.

The property must be the main residence of the disabled person throughout the grant period of five years.\nThe grants are targeted at residents on low incomes and are means-tested to take into account the household’s average weekly income and any savings but will disregard certain disability-related income.\nThere is no means of testing for families of disabled children under 19.\nYou should complete the\nfinancial self-assessment tool\n, which allows you to see if you’re likely to qualify for grant funding.\nYou may receive a grant for the cost of any assessed adaptations, less the amount you may have to contribute.\nFor example, if a stair lift costs £1,500 and you have an assessed contribution of £500, you would receive £1,000 (Please note: grants cannot be paid for works that have been carried out before formal grant approval).\nThe Occupational Therapy service will assess the need for adaptations at your home. They will also consider other appropriate solutions with you, including other, more suitable accommodation.\nTo make a referral to the Occupational Therapy Team, contact the Knowsley Access Team at 0151 443 2600 or send them an\nemail\n.\nProfessional referrals for adults can also be made online via the\nKnowsley Adult Social Care Portal\n. Follow the steps in the portal to make a professional referral for either an Urgent Moving and Handling Assessment, an Aids and Adaptations Referral, or a Deaf Services referral (via the Sensory Loss Referral link). Please note you will need to create an account to make an online referral; once created, this can be logged into for any future referrals made or for retrieving previous referrals completed.\nFor more information or further details on how to apply, contact Social Care on 0151 443 2600 or send them an\nemail\n.\nFor non-complex aids and adaptations, contact The Knowsley Care and Repair Service by\nemail\nor telephone 0151 548 6668.

This includes disregarded income or savings.\nIs it possible to ask the landlord to reduce the rent, or for you to move to cheaper accommodation?\nCan anyone else living in the household help financially towards the shortfall?\nAre there any health issues to be considered?\nCan any other services help, such as social services?",

    "text": "Important information\nThe council has introduced these charges because it can no longer afford to provide the service for free. The majority of other councils charge for pest control, and the rates charged by the Knowsley Council are lower than those charged by commercial companies.\nThe council is not legally bound to provide a free pest control service, and the responsibility for controlling pests lies with the owner or occupier of the premises or land where they are present.\nThe charge for pest control covers a maximum of two visits for rats and mice, as most domestic infestations can be eradicated in two visits. If an infestation is heavy and more visits are required, there will be an additional charge.\nIf you have spotted mice or rats on your property but cannot afford the charge for a pest control visit, there are a number of simple things you can do to prevent or control the infestation yourself. Traps and baits are widely available at DIY stores and garden centres.\nIf you are a tenant, your landlord may be responsible for paying for pest control treatment. This will depend on the terms of your tenancy agreement, whether the infestation pre-dated you moving in, and whether the problem has been made worse by disrepair or caused by your actions.\nIf you have made a pest control appointment and need to cancel, you will receive a full refund if you give at least 24 hours' notice. There will be no refund for cancellations made on the day of the visit or if you are not at home when the operative calls.\nThe council is working with social landlords to improve tenancy management and minimise the risk of infestation.",

    "text": "Huyton\nHuyton is of ancient origin and is mentioned in the Domesday survey of 1086 as Hitune, possibly meaning 'High Town'. Over the centuries, several notable families have owned it: the Lathoms, the Stanleys (the name of the Earls of Derby), and the Molyneux-Seels. At one time, the area was heavily forested and later became agricultural.\nThe introduction of the Turnpike Trust in the early 18th century resulted in the building of a road from Prescot to Liverpool. The world's first passenger railway from Liverpool to Manchester in the 19th century brought further change. The branch station opened in Huyton in 1872, making Huyton a popular location for several villa estates.\nIn the mid-20th century, further land in and around Huyton was developed to address the demand for housing from the overflow population in Liverpool's urban areas.\nThe route:\nOn Archway Road, once known as Sandpit Lane, you can see the Grade II listed Railway Bridge. When the foundations were being dug for the bridge, the remains of a vessel were found, probably Viking in origin.\nOn the right-hand side of Blacklow Brow it was used to be the Ewanville estate, which extended from the bottom of Blacklow Brow to The Rooley. Ewanville was the home of the Beecham family, founders of the famous pharmaceutical firm. One member of the family, Sir Thomas Beecham, was a world-famous conductor. The house was demolished in 1933 to make way for the housing that can be seen today.\nThe Rooley was a small pathway until 1897 when it was adopted as a public road. The name derives from 'Roolowe', which was recorded in a document from 1343.\nThe Queens Arms has an interesting history. It was once the site of a row of shops patronised by servants from Knowsley Hall who would travel by horse and cart. It was also a lodging house that accommodated the workers building the railway.\nHuyton railway station was initially called Huyton Gate and is one of the original stations on the historic Liverpool to Manchester line. Royalty came frequently to this station when staying at Knowsley Hall, and it was customary for the stationmaster, in top hat, to greet them and precede them out by walking backwards.\nHuyton Hall was once a successful girls' school, Huyton College, founded in 1894. The college motto was 'Fideliter Fortiter Feliciter, (Loyalty, Pluck, Cheerfulness).\nThe Orchard is a gently curving, tree-lined road with various imposing residences built for colliery owners, shipowners and merchants. It was one of Huyton's wealthiest developments. Greenhill was the home of Lord Cozens-Hardy, and Beaconsfield had two tennis courts, an orchard, a playing field and gardens set in four acres of land.\nIn St Mary's Road are many fine houses, and the deeds of some strangely forbade the \"curing of kippers\", \"strawberry garden parties\", and \"traction engines\". Of interest are numbers 20 and 22 and number 58a, an old coach house and number 60a, old stables.\nHuyton Hey Manor was originally a farmhouse dating from 1670 and is Huyton's oldest surviving secular building.\nVictoria Road, part of another of Huyton's conservation areas, has the character of a Victorian suburb and contains some grand houses, for example, Newlands and Hollinside. Also of note is the Grade II listed Huyton Reformed Church, built in 1890 and influenced by Truro Cathedral. Park Hall, the original Congregational church, is also Grade II listed, of neo-gothic design and built in 1856 with stone from the Huyton quarry.\nThe statue is of Harold Wilson of Rievaulx, who was Prime Minister of Britain and Labour MP for Huyton for 33 years. Tom Murphy was the sculptor.\nWhilst the 19th century saw much development of villa dwellings in Huyton, modest terraced housing was also provided. Examples of these are the mock Tudor cottages along Blue Bell Lane and the houses on Derby Terrace and Stanley Road.\nHuyton Cross was erected in 1897 to commemorate Queen Victoria's Jubilee. This was once the village green and was a popular spot for cock fighting and bull-baiting. This was eventually stopped by the vicar of St. Michael's Church, who erected the original cross in 1819 to prevent such activity.\nSt. Michael's Church is Grade II* listed and dates back to the 12th century and, over time, has been altered and extended. Inside the church is an early Norman font, a chancel screen dating from 1460 and a 14th-century effigy of a priest, probably John de Winwick. The gateways, both listed, are constructed of stone with wrought iron piers and dated 1765.",

    "text": "Kirkby\nRecorded in the Domesday Book as Cherchebi, Kirkby was one of six manors held by Uctred, the thane. In the mid-16th century, it passed to the Earls of Sefton, who remained the predominant landowners until they sold the land to the Liverpool Corporation in 1947.\nFor the first thousand years of its existence, farming and its related occupations were all Kirkby knew, and up until the 1920s, produce was still taken by horse and cart to the markets in Liverpool.\nIn 1884, the Liverpool, Bolton and Bury railway came to Kirkby, and with it, the development of the Victorian suburbs to accommodate the businessmen who commuted to Liverpool for work. Kirkby retained its rural feel well into the 20th century.\nA more significant change came in 1935 when the East Lancashire Road was built, and later, in 1940, 12 farms were taken over by the Ministry of Defence to build the Royal Ordnance Factory, a major employer in the town. Industrial growth continued into the 1960s when the Kirkby Industrial Estate was built.\nThe population of Kirkby exploded in the 1950s, and Kirkby New Town was born to meet the demand for housing from Liverpool.\nThe route:\nConstruction of the present St Chad’s Church began in 1869 and was built on the site of an earlier chapel, probably Norman. It was designed by Paley and Austin, renowned Victorian architects and built from red sandstone quarried locally in Melling and Kirkby. Its most treasured possession is the Norman sandstone font, striking in appearance with its ring of carved figures around the basin with a double row of serpents, one with three heads, representing the three enemies of man.\nMillbrook Park, Millennium Green. Follow the footpath through the park, an area of natural beauty and host to various habitats. Follow the date line, mosaic designs inlaid in the footpath, depicting Kirkby’s history.\nThe earliest reference to a mill on Mill Lane was in the 13th century, and a mill and pond are clearly marked on a map of 1769.  The mill, demolished in the 1950s, was used to grind corn and wheat and saw timber from local woods. Mill Dam Lake was popular for boating and swimming with both local people and day trippers from Liverpool. At one time, there was also a waterfall.\nThe name Deerbolt has interesting origins. Sandstone for building came from small quarries known locally as Delphs. Deerbolt or Deerbough Delph was an early 19th-century quarry disused from the 1870s.\nMill Lane Cottages were built in 1885 from brick and locally sourced sandstone. Notice the decoration on the gables.\nNorth Park Road and South Park Road are both designated conservation areas. The two short tree-lined avenues were developed after the coming of the railway, and the impressive villas reflect the status of their owners, for example, Waverly House and Ivylea. Waverley House dominates South Park Road and is Grade II listed. Built of brick, with stone dressings, it has a large square tower of three storeys with a pyramid roof.\nTwo groups of semi-detached cottages dating from 1911 have the Molyneux Cross set in the wall. In the 17th century, the powerful and wealthy Molyneux family owned Sefton, Kirkby, Tarbock, Toxteth and many other parcels of land around Liverpool.\nOpposite James Holt Way were the Cocoa Rooms. Built in 1735, it was used as a café and hired out rooms on the first floor for meetings. By the 20th century, it had become a general store.\nSefton Cottage is Grade II listed and built from materials typical of the area.\nThe Weeping Stone, originally shaped like a cross, was found by excavators working on a new housing estate in Kirkby.  It was a stopping place used to rest the coffins during the funeral procession, hence the origins of its name, the Weeping Stone.",

    "text": "Knowsley Village\nKnowsley Village, once owned by the Earls of Derby, is documented in the Domesday Book of 1086 and considered one of the best village cores in Merseyside.\nToday, it is still predominantly rural and retains a character reminiscent of pre-war England. Knowsley Village conservation area, designated in the 1970s, is typical of a historic village with a village green at its centre. The parish church, village hall, school, the Derby Arms hotel, and the estate workers' houses indicate the influence of the Earls of Derby. Since the Second World War, several housing estates have been built to accommodate the growing population.\nThe route:\nThe Derby Arms was built in 1900, and the first tenant was James Hornby. It bears the crest of the Stanley family, the Eagle and Child, and the motto of ‘Sans Changer’, meaning ‘Without Change’.\nAfter passing the Old Post Office, which opened in 1895, you come to the almshouses, originally named Countess Mary’s Bungalows. They were built in 1883 for retired estate workers, who had rules to abide by and were issued with a uniform to wear! Note the plaque in memory of Frederick Arthur, the 16th Earl of Derby.\nThe village shop is typical of many of the buildings in Knowsley. It was built in the 1880s from local brick and sandstone. The slate roof tiles are also a typical feature.\nThe Grade II listed church of St. Mary the Virgin was built in 1844 by Edmund Sharpe of Lancaster, with the Derby Memorial Chapel, designed by E.G. Paley, being added in 1871.  Paid for by the 13th Earl of Derby for £20,000, the church was added to by the later Earls. Its lavish furniture and fittings reflect the great wealth of the benefactors.\nAround the picturesque village green, also known as Maypole Green, you can see a variety of buildings, including the village hall built in 1897. The village hall is still active, hosting meetings and exhibitions. The Memorial Cross commemorates the men lost in the First World War, and the village green may have been the site of the smithy of William Woods in the 1780s.\nAlong School Lane are some of the oldest buildings in the village, including Maypole Farm, which dates from 1772. The cottages and farms were once the homes of the Earls of Derby’s estate workers.\nThe School House, now Millbrook Restaurant, was built in 1845 by the 13th Earl of Derby. The first school mentioned in Knowsley was founded by Margaret Beaufort, who was the second wife of the first Earl.\nWalking along Tithebarn Road, you will see some of the finest houses in the village. Knowsley Vicarage was built around 1885 and is Grade II listed. It is constructed in red brick, terracotta and sandstone. Many of the local houses built at the same period share characteristics of the vicarage, including tall chimneys and jettied windows. Further down are the housing developments of the 1960s and 70s.\nShop Road includes both 19th-century and more recent buildings, one of which stands on the site of Knowsley Village Clubhouse and bears a plaque to reflect that history.",

    "text": "Cronton\nCronton, whose Saxon name Crawenton means ‘Settlement of Crows’, is a small village that appears in the Norman document the Testa de Nevill. The conservation area has some outstanding buildings in various architectural styles, ranging from the impressive manor house, Cronton Hall, to the localised architecture of local sandstone and brick.\nArable land surrounds the village, and Pex Hill, an attractive wooded recreational area, stands on the land around and including the site of a 17th-century sandstone quarry.\nThere was once an important tool-making industry in Cronton, pre-dating the Industrial Revolution. It seems likely that files were made here, probably for use by the clock and watchmakers in Prescot. Later, the tools were used to finish off and re-sharpen the drawing dies used in the Warrington wire works. The last of these small workshops was on Upton Lane, finally closing in 1926.\nThe Cronton walk will not accommodate wheelchairs or prams.\nSee disability access information\nThe route:\nOn the village green, you can see the war memorial and the Cronton Stocks. The stocks are believed to date from the Medieval period and are unusual as they have five holes.\nThe Unicorn public house dates from the 18th century and was formerly called the Horns Inn.\nFollow the footpath sign, adjacent to house number 337, and walk through the open fields towards Penny Lane. You will cross a bridge over Tue Brook, a common name for a small stream, often man-made, that drained farmland.\nTown End Farm is a Grade II listed building of red sandstone and half-timbered at the rear. Although a stone bears the date 1705, it is thought that part of the building dates from 1560. It suffered neglect in the 1950s when it was used as a lodging house for transient agricultural workers.\nWhere Smithy Lane meets Hall Lane is the Medieval Cronton Cross. Cronton did not have a burial ground, and the cross may have been a stopping place for funeral processions en route to Farnworth Church.\nCronton Hall is a fine example of the ‘Queen Anne’ style of architecture and dates from the early 1700s. The gate posts at the front of the hall are Grade II listed, and the two square stone piers have tall, slender urns on the top and wrought iron gates. Cronton Hall itself is surprisingly unlisted.\nAlongside Cronton Hall is Lyme Tree Court. Here, you can see some renovated 18th and 19th-century brick barns and a stone coachhouse, which is built around a cobbled courtyard.\nSunnyside Farm is Grade II listed, built in brick and dates from the early 17th century. It is a rare example of cruck construction, of low proportions, with pig sties to the side. Town End Cottages, opposite, are also worth looking at.\nPex Hill is a small hill, 67 metres high. During the plague years, wooden cabins were built there, and plague victims were left to die, then burnt,   cabins and all! Follow the well-trodden paths across the heathland to the top of the hill. From here, on a clear day, you can see the Clwydian Hills of North Wales, Hope Mountain near Wrexham and Liverpool’s two cathedrals.",

    "text": "Halewood\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, Halewood changed little over the centuries. In the 1700s, it had a cottage industry of weaving, four tool and parts makers, two tanneries and two alehouses, the Cock and Trumpet and the Eagle and Child. The area remained predominantly rural until the mid-19th century and the introduction of the railway. From the mid-1950s onwards, large housing estates, including tower blocks, were built, and the population had increased ten-fold by the 1970s.  In 1963, the Ford Motor Company came to Halewood, and production began with the Ford Anglia; the first car off the production line was preserved at Liverpool Museum.\nHalewood also boasts a pet cemetery on Higher Road with over 560 graves. One of the earliest dates is from 1922 and commemorates a cat called ‘Bonar’. The largest grave is for ‘Blackie’, a horse who served in the Royal Artillery during the First World War.\nThe route:\nThe first railway station in Halewood opened in May 1874 and was situated on Bailey's Lane. It was reached by a ramp close to the Derby Arms. The opening of the railway gave local residents not only the opportunity to travel but also a wider choice of occupations other than farming. The old station closed in the 1950s, but the cottages built for the early railway workers can still be seen.\nThe Derby Arms public house we see today was built in the 1930s, but the original was built over 100 years ago. There was a field at the back of the pub that served as a venue for celebrations such as Empire Day and for days out by parties of children from Liverpool coming to enjoy the countryside.\nHollies Cottage has had a variety of uses. It was formerly a blacksmith and a private school run by Miss Hilton and Miss Hancock. They were the aunts of William Grace, who ran Court Farm. The school was attended by the children of wealthy parents who would take their children to school in a pony and trap. At one time, there was also a weighbridge situated here.\nThe Eagle and Child, built around 1750, is believed to be one of the oldest buildings in the village. It has been greatly altered, but some of the original building remains. The Crosby family ran the pub for many years and also ran the adjacent blacksmiths and coffin makers.\nThese four late C19 black and white Tudor-style cottages retain much of their original character. Number 1 was once the home of Misses Alice and Lizzie Jump, former teachers in Halewood.\nCourt Farm Wood is a public green space occupying the former site of Court Farm. Of interest is the pond and old wall. Follow the footpath sign for Cartbridge Lane.\nSt. Nicholas Church was built from sandstone from Woolton and Huyton quarries and opened in 1839. It is Grade II listed in the Gothic style with 21 stained glass windows, 17 of which were designed by William Morris.  The church was altered in 1841, and the tower with bells was added in 1883. The churchyard contains the graves of many notable people, including William Imrie of the White Star Shipping Line, owners of the Titanic. The rectory at the back of the church has a late Georgian frontage with its original patterned windows.\nIn 1842 St. Nicholas Church school was opened for £300 on land given by Lord Derby. In 1847, a second school was built so boys and girls could be taught separately.  Originally lit by candles, then paraffin lamps, it wasn’t until the 1920s that they were wired up for electricity. The school closed in 1989 and was converted to residential properties. A former pupil was John Hilton Grace, born on 21st May 1873. After going to Cambridge University to study mathematics, he found fame as a mathematician. He died in 1953 and is buried in the family grave at St. Nicholas Church.\nThe land for the Hilton Grace Recreation Ground was donated by William H Grace, who ran Court Farm in memory of his youngest brother, who died in a punting accident in Surrey.",

    "text": "Prescot\nPrescot is one of the oldest towns in Merseyside, and it is believed that an early Christian church was established here in the 7th century. In medieval times Prescot was a thriving market town and the ecclesiastical centre of a large parish covering much of southwest Lancashire.\nThe 18th century brought considerable changes to Prescot, and the continued growth in several craft industries created one of the earliest centres of the Industrial Revolution. These craft industries were concentrated around watchmaking, tool making and the potteries, resulting in Prescot’s increased prosperity. The town also had close links with Liverpool’s expanding overseas trade and, as a result, became an important coaching centre on the Lancashire Turnpike System.  As the old trades disappeared, other industries replaced them, and during the 20th century, BICC was a big local employer, utilising the highly skilled watch-making workforce. Prescot once had an unusual tradition known as the Perrying Ceremony. It involved the officers of the Court Leet throwing heated pennies from the windows of the Town Hall into the marketplace below. People would then scramble to pick them up. While walking the Prescot trail, look out for Stone Street, officially the narrowest named street in the country.\nThe route:\nSt. Mary’s Church is the only Grade I listed building in the borough of Knowsley and dates predominantly from 1610. The church contains several items from earlier buildings, including a C15 vestry, intricate woodcarvings, panelling and an Anglo-Saxon font. The tower and spire, added in the late 1720s, are thought to be the work of a pupil of Sir Christopher Wren.\nVicarage Place is a fine example of a Georgian street. Number 10 Vicarage Place dates from the early 18th century and has some attractive Victorian cast iron railings and gateposts. On the front of number 8 can be seen the Coat of Arms of King's College, Cambridge, originally on the Town Hall of 1755. In 1445, King Henry IV granted the Parish and Manor of Prescot to his newly established college in Cambridge.\nThe church of Our Lady Immaculate and St. Joseph was built in 1856-7 and designed by the architect Joseph Hansom. Hansom became famous for inventing the ‘Hansom Cab’.\nWest Street has dwellings of various dates, including an attractive Victorian terrace (nos. 12-20) and number 4, which still retains a watchmaker gallery at the rear.\nThe Clock Face public house, Grade II listed, was originally called West End House. It was built in the late 18th century as a Dower House for the widow of the Earl of Derby.\nThe Sun Inn dates from 1798 and is said to be the oldest public house in continuous occupation in Prescot. In the 1840s, it was a coaching inn, and for a short time, it was the Excise Office.\nPrescot Museum is a handsome brick Georgian townhouse dating from 1776, originally the site of the local cock fighting pit. During the 19th century, it became Parr’s Bank and later the National Westminster Bank before opening as a museum in 1982.\nIn the late 19th century, the Prescot watch-making industry was collapsing, and in 1889, the Lancashire Watch Making Company was formed. They built a warehouse and specialist workshop known locally as the ‘Flatiron Building’, and various local watch-making companies were bought out and the workers employed here.\nAlong Ecclestone Street is evidence of Medieval Prescot; of note is number 30. Interestingly, the right-hand gable is genuine 17th-century, and the left-hand side is a 20th-century copy. Some of the other shops, behind their modern frontages, have remains of 17th-century buildings.\nPrescot War Memorial, sculpted by Walter Gilbert and Louis Weingartner, shows a young army officer holding a gun, standing on top of the tall Portland stone pedestal. It is unusual because the date plaque shows that it was unveiled in 1916, two years before the First World War ended.",

    "text": "Before you apply\nYou must read and agree to our\nTerms and Conditions\n.\nBefore applying to close a road for a street party, you should consider the following:\nInsurance & Indemnity\nThe Borough of Knowsley will not be held responsible for any damage to property or injury to any person arising from or in connection with the street party or other event.\nIt is your responsibility to consider whether to arrange an appropriate policy of insurance that will protect and indemnify you against any claim or cost arising from such an incident; that decision remains solely yours.\nFurther advice on obtaining such insurance can be found\nhere\n.\nRisk assessments\nWe do not require you to provide us with a formal risk assessment but you should think about what could go wrong and have a backup plan. We recommend you read the advice that can be found at\nwww.thebiglunch.com\nand\nwww.streetparty.org.uk\n.\nAlcohol licence\nLicences are only required if alcohol is sold. At a private party, sharing drinks with your neighbours does not require a licence.\nIf you do want to sell alcohol, you will need to contact the Council’s licensing team for a Temporary Events Notice form. This form costs £21, and you should apply at least ten working days before your event. For more information, contact the licensing team on 0151 443 2300 or\nsend them an email\n.\nMusic or entertainment licence\nIf your street party is a private party for residents and the music is not advertised in advance to attract people, and you’re not making money, then there is no need for a licence for your music, whether it’s live or recorded.\nFood permits\nAs a private party, you do not need a licence under the Licensing Act 2003 to sell food (unless you want to only sell hot food and drink after 11pm). Remember you can always ask your neighbours to bake a cake, make a sandwich or bring food to share. This is also a good way to bring different groups of people together.\nTombolas and raffles\nIf the tombola/raffle tickets are sold on the day, and the prizes are not worth more than £500, they will be exempt from gambling regulations; however, if tickets are sold before the event, you will need a lottery registration. Please speak to Knowsley's licensing team on 0151 443 2300.\nAny proceeds from the tombola/raffle must go to a good cause, such as charity or even covering the cost of your party. Alternatively, if you want to raise money for your local church or charity, you can always ask people for donations.\nNoise\nPlease be considerate of neighbours who may not be participating in your event – remember there may also be shift workers or children trying to sleep even in the daytime. If you have to talk louder against any music, then it’s probably too loud for neighbours.\nNoise travels further at night, and if it is warm, windows and doors may be open.  Please bear this in mind when planning what type of activities you may organise for the evening.\nThe council recommends that street parties finish no later than 9pm.\nTraffic Management\nThe council does not have road signs that you can borrow and recommends hiring appropriate signs and barriers from a local hire centre. Signs must be waterproof if the weather is wet and reflective if your street party lasts until dusk/nightfall.\nAccess\nYou must also be aware of the needs of others, such as visiting doctors and nurses and other home visiting services and make suitable arrangements.\nCleaning up\nYou will need to clean up after your street party. It’s your street, your party, so keep your local area clean and tidy. Let people know in advance what time the party will finish and have a section set aside for bin bags and recycling.",

    "text": "Understanding Community Asset Transfer\nCommunity asset transfer involves transferring ownership or management of land or buildings from the council to a local community organisation. This guidance outlines the process for evaluating requests for community asset transfers and ensures fair and transparent decision-making.\nWhen Community Asset Transfer is considered\nCommunity asset transfer may be considered in two situations:\nCouncil-initiated disposal\nWhen the council decides to sell land or buildings and is willing to forgo financial gains for potential community benefits.\nCommunity-initiated request\nWhen an existing community organisation or resident within council-owned properties expresses interest in exploring asset transfer.\nThe council does not encourage speculative approaches for asset transfer.\nGuiding principles for Community Asset Transfer\nThis guidance provides a clear framework for assessing all expressions of interest in community asset transfer.\nRecognising community benefits\nThe council acknowledges the multiple advantages of community asset transfers and actively seeks to utilise asset transfer as a strategic tool.\nBalancing benefits and outcomes\nWhile the council values community benefits, it also considers other potential benefits or outcomes, such as financial returns from commercial rentals, future investment value, or regenerative benefits from asset disposal.\nBalancing asset sales and community regeneration\nThe council has existing guidelines for disposing of underused or surplus assets while investing in infrastructure projects. It strives to maintain a balance between asset sales for funding investments and regenerating communities through alternative uses.\nConsideration of risks and opportunities\nThe council's decision-making process involves weighing community benefits against the risks involved in asset transfer and the opportunity cost of alternative options.\nSupporting a stronger third sector\nThe council recognises that effective community asset ownership and management can contribute to a stronger third sector and revitalised local communities.\nAlignment with corporate goals\nThe council aims to ensure that any asset transfers align with its broader objectives outlined in the Corporate Plan and other relevant strategies.\nDecision making process\nFollowing evaluation of a proposed community asset transfer, a report with recommendations will be presented to the Executive Director of Place for a decision. This decision will be made in consultation with the Cabinet Member with Portfolio for Regeneration, Economy, and Skills.\nSchool buildings and landholding\nSchool buildings and landholding are not covered under this guidance. Any disposal of such assets would require prior approval under Section 77 of the Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998.",

    "text": "The potential benefits of Community Asset Transfer\nThe council owns a diverse range of land and buildings used for various purposes, including private, social, community, and public services. For some of these assets, transferring ownership and management to the community can bring significant benefits.\nBenefits for the local community\nResponsive management\nCommunity ownership fosters closer identification with local needs, leading to more responsive management of facilities.\nExpanded usage and activities\nIncreased use of facilities and a wider range of activities can promote health and wellbeing within the community.\nEmpowering local engagement\nCommunity asset transfer can act as a catalyst for local volunteering and active involvement in shaping and revitalising neighbourhoods, enhancing community cohesion.\nBenefits for the council and public sector\nAlignment with council objectives\nActivities supported or safeguarded through asset transfer can directly contribute to the council's objectives and the Corporate Plan.\nEstate rationalisation\nAsset transfer can contribute to the council's goal of streamlining its property portfolio and promoting more efficient asset utilisation.\nCivic engagement and volunteering\nCommunity asset transfer can foster increased levels of volunteering, civic participation, and engagement in positive activities within the borough.\nFinancial savings\nAsset transfer can lead to financial savings for the council, including reduced staff and asset overhead costs, as well as business rates.\nEncouraging external investments\nCommunity asset transfer can attract external investments into areas of need that the council may not be able to secure on its own, such as grant funding, social investment, local philanthropy, and the engagement of local employers through corporate social responsibility initiatives.\nBenefits for the community and social enterprise sector\nEnhanced capacity and recognition\nCommunity asset transfer can bring financial security, recognition, and enhanced management capacity for community and social enterprises.\nNew ventures and partnerships\nAsset transfer can foster the creation of new community businesses, social enterprises, and partnerships.\nCommunity enterprise development\nIt can build capacity within the community to take on the delivery of public services and develop as a community enterprise.\nStimulating social markets\nAsset transfer can stimulate new social markets among community and social enterprises.\nDiversifying public service providers\nIt can diversify the supply base for public services, providing more options for service delivery.\nImproved access to funding\nCommunity and social enterprises may gain improved access to funding and contract opportunities at local, regional, and national levels.\nDemonstrating benefits\nAny proposal to transfer an asset to the community will need to clearly demonstrate a range of the above outcomes and benefits.",

    "text": "National Policy Context\nThere is a strong national policy across different government parties to encourage the transfer of public land and buildings to community organisations. This is seen as a way to improve local communities by:\nEncouraging active citizenship and civil renewal\nEnhancing local public services\nReducing poverty\nPromoting economic growth\nCommunity Right to Challenge\nThe Localism Act of 2011 introduced the Community Right to Challenge, which gives community groups and voluntary organisations the right to express interest in managing council services.\nLocal authorities are also required to keep a list of assets nominated by the community as having \"community value.\" Both these initiatives are like community asset transfers. However, the Act does not automatically grant the organisation that expresses interest the right to deliver a service or manage an asset of community value, it also does not guarantee their success in any mandatory procurement process.\nOther statutory provisions\nOther laws provide community organisations and social enterprises with new ways to obtain and develop land, buildings, and privately owned assets. The Public Request to Order Disposal provisions, now known as the Right to Reclaim Land, and revisions to Compulsory Purchase guidance aim to increase community involvement in proactive regeneration efforts.\nLocal strategic context and links to other strategies\nThis guidance must align with the approach and desired outcomes of other council strategies, policies, and initiatives.\nAll transfer proposals must explicitly contribute to and impact the borough's needs as set out in the following documents:\nStrategy for Knowsley\nCorporate Plan\nMedium Term Financial Strategy\nCorporate Property Plan\nCooperative Principles\nSocial Value Model\nUnitary Development Plan\nSupplementary Planning Documents\nEconomic Regeneration Plan\nGreen Spaces Standard\nSpecific regeneration and development plans\nAny other policies relevant to a particular proposal\nThis guidance is not a standalone document, and in many cases, other outcomes and benefits may outweigh those derived from community asset transfers.",

This protects the future of these assets and ensures the council can determine any future changes in use and occupation during the lifetime of the lease.\nLease duration\nThe length of the lease should be appropriate to the business case and where appropriate, long enough to attract funders and investments.\nProtection of existing user groups\nWhere an element of wider community usage is retained after the transfer, there will be a requirement to protect existing user groups in terms of usage and charges for a limited period.\nManagement agreement\nThe social value and outcomes to be delivered, along with any other conditions or grants, will form part of a management agreement.\nCompliance monitoring\nCompliance with the management agreement will be monitored by the council as specified in the agreement.\nBelow-market value transfers\nIf a below-market value transfer is acceptable, the council will apply appropriate legal restrictions to the lease and management agreement to ensure the asset remains a community benefit and for the purposes agreed.\nConsequences of non-compliance\nFailure to comply with the management agreement can result in the management agreement ceasing and the lease will automatically terminate at the same time.\nThird-Party Control\nWhere control is passed to a third-party organisation for any purpose other than community use and benefit, this relationship will be on a commercial basis.\nAdditional notes\nWhen an agreed Asset Transfer is confirmed, new leaseholders will be required to maintain current user groups hire rates for the first 12 months. New user group hire rates can be determined by the new leaseholder.",

    "text": "Challenges and risks\nThe council recognises that there are potential challenges and risks associated with Community Asset Transfers that need to be carefully considered before making a decision to proceed. Therefore, all proposals will be evaluated against a comprehensive set of criteria to ensure that the benefits outweigh the potential drawbacks.\nKey Challenges and Risks\nLoss of capital receipt\nWhen a community organisation takes ownership of an asset, the council forfeits the potential capital gain from selling it on the open market. This could limit the council's ability to invest in other strategic initiatives.\nLoss of wider strategic benefits\nThe council may have identified specific strategic plans for the asset, such as redevelopment or future use for community purposes. A Community Asset Transfer could hinder these plans and potentially deprive the community of these benefits.\nValue for money concerns\nThe council needs to ensure that the potential benefits outweigh the costs, including any ongoing maintenance or operating expenses that will be transferred to the community organisation.\nCompliance with state aid and procurement rules\nCommunity Asset Transfer must adhere to the relevant state aid and procurement regulations to ensure fair and transparent processes.\nCapacity of community organisations\nThe council needs to assess the capacity of the proposed community organisation to effectively manage and maintain the asset, ensuring that it delivers the desired social, economic, and environmental outcomes.\nRisk of community organisation failure\nThere is a possibility that the community organisation may experience financial difficulties or cease to exist, potentially leading to the asset's deterioration or loss.\nOngoing council liabilities\nThe council may still be liable for certain obligations related to the asset, even after it has been transferred.\nFit for purpose assessment\nThe asset must be suitable for the intended use and should not impose an unreasonable burden on the community organisation or the council.\nFairness and equity\nThe council should strive to ensure that Community Asset Transfers are conducted fairly and equitably, avoiding any potential unfair advantage for one group over another.\nCommunity cohesion and reputational impact\nCommunity Asset Transfers should be carefully evaluated to minimise any potential negative impacts on community cohesion or the council's reputation in the community.",

    "text": "Creating a business case for a Community Asset Transfer\nAs many organisations applying for a community asset transfer may have limited financial history or facilities management experience, developing a robust business model supported by a solid business case is crucial. This guidance requires organisations to demonstrate their ability to manage a leased asset effectively through a business case validated by council officers.\nThe detailed requirements of this business case are outlined in Appendix A. It is the organisation's responsibility to create and present the business case, as this forms part of their overall business demonstration. The council cannot produce the business case due to a conflict of interest. However, the council can provide guidance on content, signpost external sources of business support and skills development, and offer feedback on the acceptability of the plan.\nAppendix A: Expected contents of a business case for a Community Asset Transfer\nThe foundation of a successful transfer lies in the organisation demonstrating to the council a proposal with a clear business model rationale supported by a robust business plan showcasing their ability to effectively manage the asset, including the financial and organisational capacity of the applicant.\nCommunity Asset Transfer Proposal and Business Model\nOrganisation details\nWho you are and how long you have existed.\nCurrent involvement in the community.\nLegal structure, governance, and how local people are involved.\nTrack record and contact details.\nIdentified building/land\nSpecify the building or land proposed for transfer.\nLease Duration\nIndicate the requested lease length.\nFinancial support\nOutline any funding the organisation will bring to support the transfer, including refurbishment/remodelling and development grants or loans.\nProposal's needs and benefits\nExplain how the proposal meets the needs of the organisation's users, the wider community, and the council.\nDescribe the intended use of the building, including planned activities and availability.\nLocal support\nDemonstrate local support for the proposal through consultation and show that it is not solely aligned with a single interest group.\nAsset operational timescales\nProvide indicative timescales for when the asset will be operational.\nDetailed business plan\nThe business plan is the most crucial document in informing the decision about whether to proceed with a community asset transfer.\nAll business plans should address the following\nExpected outcomes and delivery program\nOutline the expected outcomes and the proposed program for delivering them.\nProposed impact and benefits\nDescribe the proposed impact and the social, economic, and environmental benefits for the local community.\nAsset management and operations\nExplain the arrangements for managing and operating the asset on a daily basis, including staff, volunteers, necessary expertise, and any training, capacity, or skills building requirements within the organisation.\nLegal compliance\nAddress compliance with relevant legislation and regulatory controls, including equality standards, safeguarding, health & safety, disability discrimination, and licensing requirements.\nTrack record and strengths\nHighlight the organisation's track record of delivering services and/or managing property.\nConduct a SWOT analysis to identify the organisation's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\nMarket needs and demand\nAssess the local needs that the activities will be responding to and the beneficiaries.\nAnalyse demand from users for the asset.\nProjected utilisation and competition\nProvide projected utilisation rates and activity timetables.\nEvaluate the supply of similar activities in the same area and determine the response strategy, whether collaboration or competition.\nPricing and charging guidance\nEstablish pricing and charging guidance for users (individuals and groups) to maximise opportunities for income generation and ensure sustainability.\nMarketing and asset investment\nDevelop a marketing plan to promote the asset to potential users, identifying methods and targeted groups.\nOutline plans for investing in and maintaining the asset, including how all health and safety responsibilities will be met.\nIdentify any sources of finance that the asset transfer will release or attract.\nFinancial projections\nProvide financial projections, including a three to five year budgeted profit and loss, a first year cashflow forecast, and any capital expenditure required to develop the asset, demonstrating the longer term financial sustainability of the proposal.\nExplain the assumptions in the financial plan and provide supporting evidence for any funding arrangements, such as grants or loans.\nRisk assessment\nConduct a risk assessment to identify potential risks and outline strategies to prevent or mitigate them.",

    "text": "Housing\nGuidance for your living arrangements 4 to 6 months after moving to the UK\nHow to rent in England\nProperty Pool Plus\nProperty Pool Plus (PPP) is the route to social housing across the 5 Liverpool City Regions of Knowsley, Halton, Wirral, Sefton and Liverpool. You need to apply to join the housing register and once your application is active you will be able to place bids on suitable properties.\nIt is important that you register for PPP as soon as you are able because the longer you have been on the register, the higher up the shortlist for a property you will be.\nDocuments you will need to apply\nYou will need to provide documents to verify your eligibility to join the scheme. As a minimum we will need a copy of your visa, passport and National Insurance Number plus proof of residency for everyone in your household.\nAvailable properties\nAvailable properties are advertised on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, we recommend that you log into your account Thursday, Sunday as all available properties will be listed for you to view. You will only see properties that you are eligible for and you can place bids on up to 3 properties per week. If your bid is successful, you will be contacted by the landlord who owns the property.\nRegister for Property Pool Plus here\nProperty websites\nThe application process and eligibility criteria is not the same as for PPP so you will need to follow the instructions the landlords provide in their adverts.\nPrivate landlords can also be found on websites such as:\nwww.rightmove.co.uk\nwww.dssmove.co.uk\nwww.spareroom.co.uk\nwww.openrent.co.uk\nhttps://www.zoopla.co.uk\n.\nIt’s often quicker to find a private rented property than wait for a social housing property due to limited availability and high demand. Check notice boards in supermarkets, small shops, newsagents, and libraries. If you use Facebook or Twitter, or any other social media, let your contacts know you are looking for a place. Ask friends or family to ask people they know or work with if they or anyone else they know has a property available to rent.\nHow long it can take to find a home\nDemand for accommodation across the Knowsley borough is exceptionally high and waiting times for accommodation vary significantly based on the needs of the applicant and their current circumstances. It is important that you apply to join PPP as soon as you can.\nIf you have not secured accommodation within 56 days of your sponsor placement coming to an end, you must approach Knowsley Housing Solutions service for expert advice on your housing situation.\nWhat Knowsley Housing Solutions can do\nYou can contact Knowsley Housing Solutions Service if you become:\nHomeless or threatened with homelessness within 56 days and\nEligible based on their immigration and residence status\nTo make a homeless presentation please\ncomplete the Knowsley Housing Solutions online presentation form\n.\nOnce you have your online presentation form, Housing Solutions will carry out an assessment with you if you are:\nHomeless or threatened with homelessness and\nEligible for help\nThe assessment will look at:\nWhy you are homeless or threatened with homelessness.\nWhat your housing needs are.\nWhat help you need to keep your current accommodation or to find alternative accommodation.\nThe homeless assessment will be given in writing. It will look at what reasonable steps you need to take and what steps Housing Solutions are expected to take. Both you and your Housing Solutions Officer will then agree a personalised housing plan (PHP) based on your homeless assessment. You will be given a copy of the assessment and a copy of your PHP.\nIf your sponsor needs you to move out\nIf your sponsor asks you to leave, if there is no other suitable sponsor available and Housing Solutions has reason to believe* you have a priority need (for example if you have children or are vulnerable), emergency accommodation will be secured while we carry out inquiries. If Housing Solutions are satisfied you are eligible and homeless, the service will take reasonable steps to help you secure accommodation.\nHousing Solutions will be mindful that you have fled your home and country because of conflict and may not have relevant documents. However they will need a copy of your visa, passport and National Insurance Number, plus proof of residency for everyone in your household.\n*‘Reason to believe is a low threshold and does not require proof.\nOther important things to consider\nFinding accommodation is part of the journey to becoming settled in your new community. You will also need to consider things like furniture and household bills so that your new tenancy is sustainable.\nTypical household bills in the UK include but are not limited to:\nRent\nCouncil tax\nUtilities (gas / electricity / water)\nTV licence\nBroadband / mobile phone\nFurniture\nCharity shops\nLike Big Help (Huyton) or Willowbrook Hospice (Prescot & Kirkby) sell donated items.\nSocial enterprises\nLike Bulky Bob's (Liverpool) offer quality second-hand furniture.\nEmergency Support Scheme\nThis scheme may be able to assist with the provision of essential furniture, up to a value of £1,000.\nTenants Extra Support Service (TESS)\nA free service funded by Knowsley Council for Knowsley residents struggling with rent arrears, debt or ill health.\nFind out more here.",

It should include what a user can do and find out in the section.\nExample\nTitle: Business, licences and consumers\nSummary: Find out more about permits and business rates, discover support services like procurement and advice. Explore opportunities like community assets, market stalls, and advertising options.\nGrouping sections\nYou should only display no more than nine sections on a landing page. This is because more than nine is hard to navigate on mobile, as the sections stack on top of each other.\nYou should group content by topics.\nExample\nSee how the sections are grouped in the\nCouncil Tax\nsection.\nUsing call-to-action buttons on a landing page\nCall-to-action (CTA) buttons allow quick access to high-priority tasks within a section.\nYou should engage with the service to understand the top tasks within a section and use Google Analytics to see what pages users engage with most. You should also monitor this over time and change it according to users' needs.\nExample\nSee the 'Make a referral' CTA in the\nAdult Social Care section.\nNumber of CTAs per landing page\nYou should only have six call-to-action buttons at a maximum on a landing page – having more than this pushes the sections further down the page on mobile.\nIf there's a need to temporarily promote important content (for example, coronavirus information), you could increase the maximum in this situation or remove one of the existing CTAs.",

Within conservation areas, the extent of ‘permitted development’ is reduced.  This means that in conservation areas a greater range of work needs planning permission.\nYou may, for example, require planning permission for extensions, garages, sheds, hardstandings, shopfronts, applying cladding or render, satellite dishes, micro-generation equipment, and erecting boundary fences or walls.  This list is not exhaustive.  In addition to the standard national requirements, the Council can change the types of development that need permission by making Article 4 Directions or can remove ‘permitted development’ rights through planning conditions.\nDevelopment affecting conservation areas or their settings will be expected to be of high-quality design which relates to its context.  See Knowsley’s published\nSupplementary Planning Documents (SPDs)\nand the relevant conservation area appraisal and conservation area management plan (above) for further guidance.",

Proposals may need to be supported by a full structural survey.\nAny proposals for demolition should show what the proposals are for replacement features, and information on landscaping and surfacing where relevant.

    "text": "How Property Pool Plus works\nAfter completing an application and providing supporting documents, applications are reviewed by the team and customers are then placed into a Band based on their priority. This can take up to 28 days and customers cannot make bids on properties until this is done.  A bid is an expression of interest in a vacant property being advertised. Applicants will only be considered for properties if they actively bid. This is where Property Pool Plus is different from traditional waiting lists where you apply and wait to receive an offer.\nIf a customer misses any documentation, they will be contacted to provide it, and the 28-day timeframe will start again.\nCustomer will be placed into either band A, B, C, or D.\nBand A\nApplications are put in this band when rehousing is urgently needed this is called Additional Preference and includes:\nThe applicant is homeless and in situations when councils must help.\nThere is a risk to life.\nSudden loss of home because of a disaster.\nOvercrowded by two or more bedrooms.\nUnder occupying social rented housing by two or more bedrooms.\nLife threatening or terminal medical issue.\nLeaving a stay in hospital.\nLocal Council Care Leavers.\nLocal Council approved Foster Carers who need to move to a larger home.\nArmed Forces with a housing need.\nBereaved partners of Armed Forces personnel who need to leave accommodation that is only for those who work in the Armed Services.\nWhen the applicant’s current home is needed for Regeneration, Compulsory Purchase Order, Local Council approved decant.\nHousing First programme which gives support and housing to those who are homeless or with health and care needs.\nBand B\nApplications are put in this band when rehousing is needed this is called Reasonable Preference and includes:\nWhen an applicant is Homeless for other reasons than included in Band A.\nStopping people becoming homeless.\nWhen people are living in unhealthy housing.\nOvercrowded by one bedroom.\nUnder occupying social rented housing by one bedroom.\nMedical or welfare reasons.\nHardship.\nBand C\nOther applicants who do not meet the criteria for Bands A or B this is called the General Band.\nBand D\nApplicants who have refused an allocation of social rented housing the maximum number of times. This includes applicants who have not put a bid on a suitable property on more than three times in 12-months.\nAllocation document\nYou can read more about allocation in the document below.\nDocument\nProperty Pool Plus Allocation Document.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.17MB\n)",

You can do this by telephoning 0151 443 2060\nOnce your Care Manager contacts us we will try to find a carer who is able to support you\nIf we think we are able to offer you a service, you and your family, or the people who currently support you, will be visited by one of our Shared Lives Workers.\nThey will support you to fill in a form called a Support Plan.  This plan will be about you, what you like / don’t like; things you are interested in and how you like to be supported.\nYou will then meet the person who we think may be suitable to support you. This meeting is called an introduction and normally takes place either in your own home or in the home of the Shared Lives Carer.\nIf you are both happy you will agree to start a partnership.\nAt this point your Shared Lives worker will draw up a Partnership Agreement with you and your carer. This is an agreement between you and your carer about how you would like to be supported.\nCan you say NO? If you are not happy with your Shared Lives carer, or do not want to continue with your arrangement at any stage, even after you have started living with someone, you can say NO. To speak to someone about your Shared Lives arrangement at any time, you can telephone the office on 0151 443 2060, between the hours of 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday, and speak to your Shared Lives worker.\nReview meetings: Your Shared Lives worker will talk to you about how things are going after a short period (usually within one month). After this initial chat, your Shared Lives arrangement will be reviewed by a Care Manager, usually once a year. You can request a review of your Shared Lives agreement at any time during this period, by speaking to your Shared Lives worker.",

    "text": "Managed migration explained\nManaged migration is where the Government moves you on to Universal Credit from another benefit even if your circumstances have not changed. This process started on a small scale in 2022 only affecting some areas nationally. However this is now progressing steadily, and it is expected that most people in receipt of a legacy benefit (Income Support, Income-based Jobseekers Allowance, Income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Child Tax Credit, Working Tax Credit, Housing Benefit) will be moved over to Universal Credit by the end of December 2025. The last benefit being moved is Income-Related Employment and Support Allowance.\nAs part of the Managed Migration process, the Government is writing to people inviting them to claim Universal Credit. The letter is called a Migration Notice. It's happening in stages depending on which legacy benefit you receive.\nOnce you have you received your letter\nThe Department for Works and Pension will be sending Migration Notices to Knowsley residents over the coming months depending on what legacy benefit you are currently receiving.\nWhen you do get this letter, do not ignore it. You must claim Universal Credit because your legacy benefit will stop after three months of the date of the letter. If you are late in making this claim you will lose any entitlement to \"Transitional Protection\". Transitional Protection is the difference between your existing entitlement and your entitlement to UC. If you were better off on your existing benefit and you claim UC before the deadline then you should be no worse off when you move to UC. If you make your claim for UC after the 3-month deadline then you will not be paid your Transitional Protection.\nIf you are living in rented accommodation and receive care, support or supervision as part of your tenancy or you are living in temporary homeless accommodation you will continue to claim Housing Benefit to support with your rent costs.\nYou have to\nclaim Universal Credit online\n(or, you can claim it over the phone in limited circumstances)\nMore information is available from the\nUnderstanding Universal Credit website\n.\nHelp with your claim\nThere are 2 ways to get help with your Universal Credit claim. You can either call the Universal Credit helpline or use the Help to claim service.\nCalls to the Universal Credit helpline are free.\nUniversal Credit helpline\nTelephone\n0800 328 5644\nWelsh language\n0800 328 1744\nRelay UK\n(if you cannot hear or speak on the phone)\n18001 then 0800 328 5644\nOther methods\nBritish Sign Language (BSL)\nvideo relay service\nif you’re on a computer\nFind out how to\nuse the service on mobile or tablet\nTextphone\n0800 328 1344\nMonday to Friday, 8am to 6pm\nFind out about call charges\nHelp to Claim\nYou can get free support from trained advisers to make a Universal Credit claim. They can help you with things like online applications or preparing for your first jobcentre appointment.\nThe Help to Claim service is provided by Citizens Advice and is confidential.

    "text": "Basic principles\nOur website is a valuable resource for residents and council employees, and it's important that everyone can access and understand the information it offers. Here are some key principles to ensure a consistent and accessible experience.\nDo\nWrite clearly and simply. Start with the same question every time: what does the user want to know?\nUse acronyms sparingly and define the ones you do use. If you need to use abbreviations, define them on their first use, at the start of a page or at the start of a journey. But it’s best to avoid them if you can.\nMake your title unique. Titles on the Knowsley Council website must be unique and informative so that users know which page they are on. Your title should be 65 characters or less (including spaces).\nRemove the date unless it makes the title unique. Put the date in the title if the page is part of a series that has the same title. It’s helpful to include the date range if you publish multiple versions of the same information for different periods of time.\nAddress the user. Address the user as ‘you’ where possible. Content on the site often makes a direct appeal to citizens and businesses to get involved or take action, for example, ‘You can contact HMRC by phone and email’ or ‘Pay your car tax’.\nDo not\nUse jargon or undefined acronyms.\nWrite long or complicated sentences. When you use a longer word (8 or 9 letters), users are more likely to skip shorter words (3, 4 or 5 letters) that follow it. So, if you use longer, more complicated words, readers will skip more. Keep it simple.\nDo not use formal or long words when easy or short ones will do. Use ‘buy’ instead of ‘purchase’, ‘help’ instead of ‘assist’, and ‘about’ instead of ‘approximately’.\nUse idioms or figures of speech.\nUse ampersands or other text symbols in place of words. Ampersands are allowed in logos but not in body copy.\nDo not include your department name unless it makes the title unique. Only add your department or agency name to the title if the content is about your department – for example annual reports or corporate information.\nFAQs are strongly discouraged on the Knowsley Council website.  If you write content by starting with user needs, you will not need to use FAQs.\nCapitalisation. DO NOT USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT. IT’S HARD TO READ.",

By September 2020, we were required to make sure that our website and all the PDFs uploaded to it, comply with the WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.\nWe are required to have an Accessibility Statement on our website, which outlines which parts of our website are not accessible and why, and what our plans to fix these elements are.\nPDF alternatives\nIf you have a new document that you would like to upload to the website, consider creating it in another way.

    "text": "Content principles\nThese principles should guide all decisions about content.\nStart with purpose\nAll of our content seeks to achieve something, and we’re clear from the start what user needs and organisational goals it serves.\nFocus on the things only we can do\nECC is responsible for a huge range of services and has ambitious strategic goals. We need to be disciplined about content prioritisation to make sure we have an impact where it counts.\nDo things once\nInformation should exist in a single place. Duplicating content is inefficient, confusing, creates SEO conflicts and makes it harder to maintain. We should identify which site, service or organisation is responsible for a piece of content and signpost users there rather than recreating it in multiple places.\nMeasure the right things\nUnderstanding content performance is about more than traffic or page views. We need to measure the impact of content on services holistically using both qualitative and quantitative data.\nPrioritise accessibility and inclusivity\nLike our services, our content is for everyone, and it shouldn’t ever be a barrier that excludes people. That means prioritising accessibility and inclusivity whenever we are making choices that affect content.\nHave a clear governance model\nOur content operating model should make roles, processes and ownership clear. And we shouldn’t ever create content without knowing how it will be maintained.\nCreate content collaboratively\nContent is a team sport. It’s stronger and more effective when it takes into account the perspectives of subject matter experts, content experts and users.\nTake content skills seriously\nExpertise in the design and management of content is a valuable and specialist skill. It’s not something that should be added on to people’s roles without training and support, and we should plan for where and how we are building content capability across the organisation.",

    "text": "Our proposition\nThis proposition statement sets out what kinds of content we do publish and what we don’t. It is based on the\nGOV.UK proposition\n.\nThis proposition statement has been produced with our main knowsley.gov.uk website in mind. To be useful it needs to be detailed, and the detail means that it won’t be applicable for every site and service.\nHaving a clear content proposition is an important part of getting set up to manage content well and make effective decisions. Whenever a new site or instance of content is being created, the default position should be that this content proposition will apply. If it does not, then exceptions to this proposition should be discussed and documented.\nWhat content goes on knowsley.gov.uk\nWe create content where there is a clear user need, backed up by evidence. The content should also meet one of the following criteria:\nCouncil services\nIt is something that can only be done with Knowsley Council, for example:\nreporting a pothole\napplying for a school place\nbooking an appointment to register a birth\nInformation and guidance about Council services\nIt is official information about something Knowsley Council do, to help people better understand how to engage with a service and self-serve more effectively where possible, for example:\nhow to make an effective request for support from Adult Social Care\nwhat documents you need to send when applying for a Blue Badge and how to upload or send them\nwho qualifies for free school meals\nSector specific guidance\nIt is sector specific guidance that aligns with a policy intent linked to user needs, for example:\nguidance for schools on developing a travel plan\nguidance on business advice provided by Knowsley Council Trading Standards\nPolicy and involving people\nIt helps us be transparent, engage with people, explain policies clearly and fulfil legal obligations, for example:\ninformation about our spending and financial performance\ninformation about policies and strategies and how they are being implemented\ngetting people’s feedback, for example through consultations\nSubsites on the Knowsley Council platform explaining openly what the council does such as Knowsley News\nResponding to major events\nIt shows what the council is doing to respond to major issues and incidents that have a direct impact on the lives of the people of Knowsley or have significant public interest, for example:\ninformation about our response to COVID-19\ninformation about support for Ukraine and our Homes for Ukraine scheme\ninformation about severe weather events\nHelping users follow the law\nIt helps people and businesses meet their legal obligations, for example:\nregistering a death\nmaking a planning and development application\nunderstanding rights and responsibilities when teaching a child at home\nSupport schemes\nIt helps people find and access council-funded support schemes, for example:\nadvice for businesses\nsupport with making your home more energy efficient\nBusiness opportunities\nIt’s a service or information helping to create or promote business opportunities in Knowsley, for example:\nopportunities to provide the council with goods and services and how to bid on a contract\ninformation about inward investment to support business expansion and investment in Knowsley\nCampaign activity and raising awareness\nThe re-platforming of knowsley.gov.uk will enable us to provide a separate platform to support campaign activity. In case of major events, this can also include some limited campaign activity published directly on the main knowsley.gov.uk site.\nWhat content does not go on knowsley.gov.uk\nOrganisations independent from the council\nContent and services supplied by organisations that are separate from the Council, including:\nNHS\nemergency services\nacademic institutions with ac.uk domains\norganisations and companies that are not publicly owned and do not provide services to the council\nAdvertising or other activities for commercial purposes\nContent, advertising or services which give a commercial advantage to an external company or organisation.\nGeneral advice\nGeneral advice content for people, businesses and specialists unless it both:\nhas a clear user need\noffers guidance or a recommendation related to a specific policy area for which we are responsible",

Try to keep banner text to around 240 characters or less.\nAnnouncement\n- used for general information announcements\nMinor alert\n- used when you need to alert user's attention to some sort of disruption\nEmergency\n- used when there is a serious disruption to a service (ie. phone lines are down)\nDeath of a notable person\n- self-explanatory and only used in rare occasions",

This might take place at any point within a six-year period of receiving the grant.\nAdditionally, at the end of each funding period, a selection of projects will be selected for full audit.\nKnowsley Council has a zero-tolerance approach to fraud/corruption.",

    "text": "Wasps\nWasps can sting and can pose a hazard if the nest is disturbed in any way. Wasp stings are not normally serious, but the elderly and those with allergies can suffer severe reactions. Unless the location of the nest is causing a problem treatment should be avoided.\nSigns to look for around your home\nWasps can be confused with other winged insects. Wasps have yellow and jet black stripes on their bodies and two pairs of wings. Queen wasps sleep in safe locations like wood piles and roof spaces during the winter months. They emerge from April onwards and seek suitable places to build new nests. Wasps build new nests each year and never return to an old nest, so it is not necessary to remove old or treated nests. Lack of activity around the nest will indicate if it is no longer active.\nNests are grey and ball-shaped and can be quite large. Other signs of a nest include:\nWasps entering and exiting buildings from one location\nWet patches on walls or ceilings\nA dull, buzzing noise\nHow to prevent wasps\n• Keep bagged refuse and lidded bins with potential food sources away from your house\n• Inspect your loft throughout the summer months to check for nests\nTreating and controlling wasps\nSelf treatment of nests that are above head height is not recommended. It may be possible to treat nests that are more easily accessible.\nBefore any self treatment we recommend that you\nRefer to the insecticide instructions before use\nIdentify the entrance and exit point of the nest\nConduct treatments at twilight when there will be less activity and most of the wasps will be in the nest\nBlow or spray the insecticide into the entry point of the nest\nMake sure other residents are aware of the treatment and that they avoid the nest area for 24 hours\nWash away any spillages of insecticide when safe to do so\nWasp stings can be dangerous and can cause severe reactions so ensure that you wear protective clothing during self treatment.",

    "text": "Ants\nBlack garden ants are a nuisance but pose no risk to human health. Their nests are found in the soil in gardens or under floors. Garden ants swarm as they fly away to find a site to create a new colony each year. This occurs naturally and is usually over within 48 hours.\nPharaoh ants\nPharaoh ants can pose a health risk as they can spread infections by penetrating food packaging and contaminating food and water. They are about 2mm long and pale yellow / brown in colour. Pharaoh ants are only found indoors. They are very agile and are able to climb smooth surfaces.\nSigns to look for around your home\nGarden ants\nAnts can be found indoors and outdoors, especially around paved areas\nTrails of ants moving to and from nest sites or open food / spillages\nSmall piles of sandy soil around thresholds\nPharaoh ants\nLong narrow trails of ants moving to and from the nest toward food sources\nThey need warm humid areas to breed so often gather near central heating systems and heated indoor areas\nAnts will forage for water around sinks and areas of condensation\nHow to prevent ants\nGarden ants\nSeal holes and gaps around windows and doors\nClean up food spillages\nStore food stuffs in sealed containers\nEmpty and clean kitchen bins regularly\nPharaoh ants are brought into the property on foodstuffs or from other infected properties. There is little you can do to prevent an infestation.\nTreating and controlling ants\nGarden ants\nInsecticidal aerosols and dusts are available from many DIY stores and garden centres. Always read directions and instructions before use.\nInsecticidal aerosols\nSpray into cracks and crevices and around skirting boards, door frames, air bricks and any other access points. Can last for several days and can also be used to control flying insects.\nInsecticidal dusts\nCan be applied directly to nests and lasts for several weeks.\nPharaoh ants\nPlease seek professional help as soon as possible.",

Where expenditure cannot be verified or where reasonable alternatives are available at a lower cost or for free, the expense may not be included or may be restricted to a lower cost determined by the Council.\nWhat happens if I own my own home?\nIf you own your home, it will only be considered as an asset if you no longer live there as your main home. For example, if you move into an extra care setting or a care home to meet your needs.\nIf you move into an Extra Care setting and you owned your former home, this will usually be included in your financial assessment. If your property is included in the financial assessment and you do not intend to sell your former home, more information will be provided during your financial assessment about your eligibility for Deferred Payments.\nThere is also more\ninformation on Deferred Payments on the Gov.uk website\n.\nHow do I pay?\nYou will receive an invoice every four weeks from the Council’s Sundry Debtor Team advising of due payment amounts and available payment methods. Invoices are issued in arrears so payment is only requested after receiving your care and support.\nYour invoice will be based on the cost of the services you have received and the amount you have been asked to pay towards your care and support.  It is important to note that you will be charged for any care that has not been cancelled with notice. For example, if a carer visits your home and you decide, when they arrive, that you do not need the care.\nAny queries around being charged for care that you do not feel has been provided should be raised with your care provider in the first instance.\nIf you receive a direct payment, the amount you need to pay will be deducted from your direct payment, and you will need to pay the difference into your direct payment account.\nIf you are having difficulty paying your bills, please tell the Council as soon as possible. They may be able to offer you information and advice which could prevent you getting behind with your bills or falling into debt. If you have any queries about making payment for your care, please ring the Council’s Sundry Debtor Team on 0151 443 4455.",

    "text": "Paying for care provided in a residential or nursing home\nWhat services do I have to pay for?\nYou will be charged for most services arranged by the Council. Residential services could include:\nRespite and short-term care in a residential setting\nResidential and Nursing Care Home – permanent placements\nResidential and Nursing Care Home – temporary placements (up to 52 weeks)\nHow will the amount I have to pay for respite and short-term care be calculated?\nIf you have a period of respite or short-term residential care and you do not have more than £23,250 in savings and investments, you will be charged a fixed amount for the respite or short-term care. The Council will not contact you to carry out a financial assessment. You will be advised during your social care needs assessment of the amount you will be required to pay.\nThe fixed amount is based on age-related minimum income amounts set by the Department for Work and Pensions annually. This is because carrying out a full financial assessment would be disproportionate for short term or temporary care arrangements.\nIf you are having difficulty paying the fixed amount you can request a full financial assessment which will consider your income, savings and any ongoing expenses. You can request this during your social care needs assessment.\nHow will the amount I have to pay for longer term Residential or Nursing care be calculated?\nIf you remain in residential care for more than eight weeks, or go into a long-term placement, an assessor from the Financial Assessment and Charging Team will contact you to gather the following:\nInformation about your income and savings\nInformation about household costs you must pay, such as your mortgage or rent, and costs for Council Tax when you own your own home\nThe financial assessment will ensure that you retain a basic level of income known as the Personal Expenses Allowance. This will ensure that you have money to spend on personal items, such as clothes and other items that are not part of your care\nThis information will be used to work out the maximum that you can be expected to pay. The Council will write to you to confirm the outcome and provide you with a copy of your financial assessment.\nHow do I pay?\nYou will receive an invoice from your care home advising that payment is now due and giving you options on how to make payment.\nYou may want to make payment to the home whilst waiting for your financial assessment to be carried out. This will prevent you receiving a backdated bill in the case of any delays. Should you wish to do this you can discuss paying a standard weekly contribution rate with the care home.\nIf you are having difficulty paying your bills, please discuss this with the care home as soon as possible. The care home will contact the Council to make them aware if necessary.\nWhat happens if I own my own home?\nIf you are staying permanently in a care home, your property will usually be included in your financial assessment. However, there are some examples where a property may not be included:\nIf your property has been continuously lived in by your spouse, civil partner, or partner\nIf your property has been continuously lived in by a relative who is aged 60 or over\nIf your property has been continuously lived in by a relative under the age of 60 who has a disability\nThe Council must not include the value of your main or only home for the first 12 weeks of permanent residential care.\nIf your property is included in the financial assessment, you may be eligible for a Deferred Payment Arrangement.\nWhat is a Deferred Payment?\nIf you have been assessed as having to pay the full cost of your care, but you cannot pay the full amount because your money is tied up in property, the Council may accept your property as security. You will continue to pay a weekly contribution towards the cost of your care and support based on your income and savings only. The amount you cannot pay will be paid by the Council and a debt will build up, known as a deferred payment. This debt will then have to be paid at a later date, for example, when you sell your property. If you choose a deferred payment, it is important to note that interest and charges will apply.\nMore information will be provided during your financial assessment if you are eligible for a Deferred Payment.\nDo I get a choice about which care home I live in?\nIf you're paying for your own care, you can choose which care home to live in. If you choose to live in an out of borough care home whilst paying for your own care, you will usually become ordinarily resident in that area. This means that any future requests for support with funding your care and support needs should be made to the local authority where the care home is situated.\nIf the Council are paying some or all of your care costs, you still have the right to choose your care home, provided that:\nThe accommodation is suitable in relation to your assessed needs\nTo do so would not cost the local authority more than the amount we usually pay for accommodation of that type\nThe accommodation is available\nThe provider of the accommodation is willing to enter into a contract with the Council to provide the care on the local authority’s terms and conditions\nThe Council must ensure at least one accommodation option is available and affordable.\nYou may still be able to choose alternative options including an out of borough care home or a more expensive setting, where a top-up fee is required, however the top-up will need to be met by a third-party, i.e., a friend or relative. There are some instances when a person can top-up their own care home fees. This will be discussed, if applicable, during the financial assessment.\nIf you are being discharged from hospital to a care home and your preferred choice is not immediately available, you will not be able to remain in the hospital. You will be transferred to an appropriate care home until your home of choice becomes available.",

    "text": "General information about financial assessments\nWhat is a financial assessment?\nA financial assessment is carried out to calculate the maximum that you can be expected to pay for support services that are provided to you.\nIn England, Councils have upper and lower limits for financial help. The table below explains the limits.\nIf you have savings\nWhat you will have to pay\nOver £23,250\nYou will pay the full cost of your care and support\nBetween £14,250 and £23,250\nYou will pay a contribution from your income (such as pensions), plus a tariff income*, and we will contribute towards your care and support.\nUnder £14,250\nYou will pay a contribution from your income (such as pensions), with no tariff income*, and we will contribute towards your care and support.\n* Tariff income assumes you have an extra £1 per week in income for every £250 (or part of) you have in savings between £14,250 and £23,250. For example, if you had £15,000 in savings this equals £750 more than the lower capital limit of £14,250, therefore you would pay £3 a week in tariff income.\nOnly the income and savings of the person receiving care and support is included in their financial assessment. If any income, benefits or savings are awarded jointly only 50% will be taken into account in your financial assessment. Please refer to example 2 on the\nExamples of common financial assessments for care provided in your home page\n.\nIf you own the property that you live in, it will only be considered as an asset if you no longer live there as your main home, for example, if you move into extra care or a care home to meet your needs.\nHow will the financial assessment be arranged?\nThe Council want to make sure you can read and understand the information we share with you. The financial assessment team will contact you to arrange your financial assessment. This will usually be a telephone call but can be arranged as a face-to-face appointment if that is required.\nIf you find it hard to read our letters or if you need somebody to support you at your appointment, please let us know.\nIf you need information in braille, large print or an easy-to-read format, or if you would benefit from having a British Sign Language interpreter or advocate present, please let us know and we will aim to support this. If you experience hearing difficulty we can make provisions to support you.\nWhat happens if I do not want to tell you about my finances?\nIf you choose not to have an assessment, you will need to pay the full cost of your care and support services.\nCan somebody attend the financial assessment with me?\nWhen attending a financial assessment, you can have people with you to support you and offer their views. This could be a carer, family member, friend or anyone else that you trust.\nIf you feel that you will find the financial assessment process difficult and you don’t have anybody to assist you, you can arrange for an advocate to attend the assessment to help you get your views across. If you think that this would be helpful you can contact Knowsley’s Advocacy Hub on\n0300 3030 624\nand arrange this.\nWhat should I do if my financial circumstances change?\nYou must notify the Council if your financial circumstances change as this can affect your financial assessment. If you do not inform the Council of a change and, as a result of that change the amount you have to pay would increase, it will be backdated to the date the change took effect.\nWhat if I give away some of my money?\nIf the Council decides you have given away some of your money or assets i.e. savings, income, or property, to avoid or reduce how much you may pay for the cost of your care, the Council might treat you as if you still had it. They may include the full value of any money or assets you have given away in your financial assessment and charge you accordingly.\nGiving away money or assets, to avoid care charges is referred to as ‘deprivation of assets’. When the Council are considering whether giving away money or property has been a deliberate deprivation of assets, they will take the following points into consideration:\nIf you knew you would need care and support at the time you gave away your assets\nIf you knew you would need to pay towards the cost of your care\nIf paying for care and support was a significant reason for you giving away your assets\nIf you give away your savings, income, or property to a friend or relative, that person may become liable to pay the difference for the cost of your care\nThe Council must base its decision on facts, and they will ask you to provide any relevant evidence to support your reason for giving away money or assets. The Council will write to you explaining its decision.\nWill my financial assessment be reviewed?\nThe Council will review your financial assessment every 12 months. This is done in April each year following annual increases to Department for Work and Pensions benefits.\nIf your financial circumstances change at any other time, you must notify the Council as this can affect your financial assessment. If you do not inform the Council of a change and, as a result of that change the amount you have to pay would increase, it will be backdated to the date the change took effect.\nWe also review the rates that we pay to our care providers each year. This may affect the amount you are charged for your care and support.\nThe Council will write to you to let you know the outcome of any reviews and provide a copy of your financial assessment.\nWhat should I do if I disagree with the assessment or need more information?\nIf you do not understand how your charge has been worked out, or you do not agree with the amount you have to pay, you should contact the Financial Assessment and Charging Team who can explain the calculation to you. You can also ask for the assessment to be reviewed.\nIt is important that you continue to pay whilst a review is being considered.\nWhat happens if I do not pay my social care charges?\nYou have a responsibility to respond to requests for information in relation to financial assessment applications and reviews, ensure invoices are paid in full and on time, and report any changes in financial circumstances promptly.\nIf you do not pay the amount that you have been assessed to pay, this may result in further action being taken to recover the debt.\nWhat happens when I am discharged from hospital with a package of care and support?\nIn Adult Social Care, the Councils' approach to hospital discharge is focused on supporting people to regain independence through personalised approaches to care and support which actively promotes choice and control. It is important that you are discharged from hospital with the right support in place.\nIf you need a package of care and support after being in hospital, the Council will complete a social care needs assessment with you in order to understand what care and support you need. Some of the support you receive when leaving hospital may be free of charge during the period of assessment only. Once all longer-term assessments have been completed, you may be required to pay towards the cost of any ongoing care and support.\nIf you are being discharged from hospital to a care home and your preferred choice is not immediately available, you will not be able to remain in the hospital and the trust may enforce their 'No Choice Policy'. This means that where a 24-hour care home placement is needed to enable a discharge from hospital, you will be transferred to an appropriate care home until your home of choice becomes available. This is not a local authority policy. If you have any concerns about your discharge arrangements, please speak to a member of staff on the ward.\nWhen you are discharged the Council will contact you to arrange a financial assessment to work out how much you will pay for your care and support.\nMore information on support to manage your finances\nMore information on support to manage your finances\nLasting Power of Attorney\nWhile you are still able to make decisions and express your views, you should think about how you want your affairs dealt with in the event that you lose mental capacity in the future.\nYou can create a Lasting Power of Attorney which grants legal authority to an attorney or attorneys to make decisions on your behalf if you lose mental capacity.\nThere are 2 types of Lasting Power of Attorney, and you can choose to make one type or both:\nHealth and welfare – this can only be used when you are unable to make your own decisions and gives an attorney the power to make decisions about your daily routine. This can include washing and dressing, eating, medical care, moving into a care home or making decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment.\nProperty and financial affairs – this can be used as soon as it is registered and gives an attorney the power to make decisions about money and property for you. This could include managing your bank or building society account, paying bills, collecting benefits or a pension or selling your home.\nIndependent Mental Capacity Advocates\nIf you lose mental capacity without a Lasting Power of Attorney in place, an application can be made for a deputyship with the Court of Protection. In certain circumstances the Council must appoint an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate to support and represent you if you lack the mental capacity to make a decisions. This can include, for example, a decision about moving into a care home, when you have nobody to support you other than paid staff.\nAll actions and decisions taken on your behalf must be made in your best interests in line with the Mental Capacity Act 2005.\nIf you have concerns about an attorney or deputy, such as concerns about the misuse of money or decisions that are not in the best interests of the person they are responsible for, you should report these to the Office of the Public Guardian using the form to report a concern about an attorney, deputy or guardian.\nYou can find more information about Power of Attorney and Court of Protection by visiting the\nGov.uk Office of the Public Guardian web page\n.\nAppointees for benefit claimants\nIf you lack mental capacity to manage your social security benefits, the Department for Work and Pensions can appoint someone else to make claims and receive benefits on your behalf. An appointee is usually a close friend or relative who visits you regularly. The Council can act as your appointee.\nAn appointee’s powers only extend to the management of social security benefits. You can find more information about becoming an appointee, including roles and responsibilities if someone takes on this role, on the\nGov.uk Becoming an appointee web page\n.",

Licences for:\na maximum of five years - may be granted to landlords who have a good track record and have shown that they will maintain good management and property standards\none year - if management arrangements or property conditions are not entirely satisfactory, or where we've had to intervene against the landlord but is not so serious as to refuse a licence, or where concerns are raised by the police or other statutory enforcement agencies.  One-year licences will also be issued to any landlords or agents operating a licensable HMO without a licence. The landlord or agent may also face prosecution.\nRefusal of a licence\nThe consequences of refusing to grant a licence are serious for both the landlord and us.   We have a duty to take on the management of the property by making an Interim Management Order.  A full option appraisal will be carried out before any decision to refuse to grant a licence is made and the making of a management order should be regarded as a last resort.  Where a proposed licence holder or manager is assessed as being not fit and proper, we will work with that person wherever possible with a view to agreeing an alternative person who is fit and proper.\nMaking an appeal\nYou may appeal if we decide to:\nrefuse a licence\ngrant a licence with conditions\nrevoke a licence\nvary a licence\nrefuse to vary a licence\nAppeals should be made to the First Tier Tribunal, normally within 28 days.

    "text": "Landlord guidance\nThe Housing Act 2004 introduced the licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) making it compulsory to licence all ‘higher-risk’ HMOs and giving powers to Councils to licence other types of ‘smaller’ HMOs to secure compliance if appropriate.\nWhat is a HMO?\nA House in multiple occupation (HMO) is defined as a building, or part of a building (for example, a flat) which:\nmore than one household lives in and shares an amenity, such as a bathroom, toilet or cooking facilities;\nis a converted building where more than one household lives and doesn't entirely comprise self-contained flats (whether or not there is also a sharing or lack of amenities); or\ncomprises entirely of converted self-contained flats and the standard of conversion does not meet, at a minimum, that required by the 1991 Building Regulations and more than one third of the flats are occupied under short tenancies, (known as Section 257 HMOs).\nAnd is 'occupied' by more than one household:\nas their only or main residence;\nas a refuge by persons escaping domestic violence;\nduring term time by students; or\nfor any other purpose as is prescribed in the regulations\nAnd the households comprise:\nfamilies (including single persons and co-habiting couples (whether or not of the opposite sex); or\nany other relationship that may be prescribed by regulations, such as domestic staff or fostering or carer arrangements\nWhy does the government want HMOs to be licensed?\nLarger HMOs, such as bedsits and shared houses, often have poorer structural integrity or facilities and management standards can often be inadequate.\nPeople who live in HMOs can be amongst the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of society. As HMOs are the only housing option for many people, the government recognises that it is vital that they are properly regulated.  Licensing is intended to make sure that:\nLandlords of HMOs (or managers who have been employed) are ‘fit and proper’\nEach HMO is suitable for occupation by the number of people permitted by the licence\nThe standard of management of the HMO is adequate\nHigh risk HMOs can be identified and targeted for improvement\nWhere landlords refuse to meet these criteria, the Council can intervene and manage the property so that:\nVulnerable tenants can be protected\nHMOs are not overcrowded\nCouncils can identify and support landlords, especially with regeneration and tackling antisocial behaviour\nDo all HMOs have to be licenced?\nNo. Under the Housing Act 2004 there are three types of licencing:\nCompulsory (required by law) licencing of HMOs for properties that are:\noccupied by five or more people in more than one household; and\nshare amenities such as bathrooms, toilets and cooking facilities\nAdditional licencing of HMOs is a discretionary power that Councils may decide to apply to a particular type of HMO, for example, two-storey properties occupied by three or more students or asylum seekers\nSelective licencing of other residential accommodation Properties that are not subject to HMO licencing could be covered under a selective licencing scheme.  This is where the Council may declare that certain areas, for example, where there is low demand for housing and/or antisocial behaviour, are appropriate for selective licencing. This licencing would cover all forms of private rented housing, including HMOs. Councils may introduce the second two types of licencing wherever they feel it is appropriate to do so. Please note that licencing only applies to HMOs where rents or other considerations are payable.\nHow does it work?\nAnyone who owns or manages a HMO that must be licenced has to apply to the Council for a licence. The Council must give a licence if it is satisfied that:\nthe HMO is reasonably suitable for occupation by the number of people allowed under the licence;\nthe proposed licence holder (and/or manager) is a fit and proper person;\nthe proposed licence holder is the most appropriate person to hold the licence;\nthe proposed management arrangements are satisfactory;\nthe person involved in the management of the HMO is competent; and\nthe financial structures for the management are suitable\nWhat does a ‘fit and proper person’ mean?\nThe Council will carry out checks to make sure that the person applying for the licence is a fit and proper person.  In deciding whether someone is fit and proper the Council must take into account:\nAny previous convictions relating to violence, sexual offences, drugs and fraud\nWhether the proposed licence holder has broken any laws relating to housing or landlord and tenant issues\nWhether the person has been found guilty of unlawful discrimination\nWhether the person has previously managed HMOs that have broken any approved code of practice.  It is advisable for the landlord or manager to be a member of a professionally recognised body, or an approved landlord’s association that is affiliated to the National Landlords Association\nWhat is in a licence?\nThe licence will specify the maximum number of people who may live in the HMO. It will also include the following conditions, which apply to every licence:\nA valid current gas safety certificate, which is renewed annually, must be provided and a valid current Electrical Installation Certificate must be provided at a minimum of every five years\nProof that all electrical appliances and furniture are kept in a safe condition\nProof that all smoke alarms are correctly positioned and installed as per the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Amendment) Regulations 2022\nEach occupier must have a written statement of the terms on which they occupy the property, for example, a tenancy agreement\nCouncils may also apply the following conditions:\nRestrictions or prohibitions on the use of parts of the HMO by occupants\nA requirement that the condition of the property, its contents, such as furniture and all facilities and amenities, bathroom and toilets for example, are in good working order\nA requirement for specified works or repairs to be carried out within a particular time frame\nA requirement that the responsible person attends an approved training course\nHow long will it last?\nA licence will normally last for a maximum of five years, although it can be for a one-year period if there are doubts over the application or how the property will be managed.\nHow much will it cost?\nLandlords will have to pay a fee to cover the administration costs of the licence procedure.  This will vary depending on the amount of time and resources that are needed to satisfy all the licencing conditions.\nCan the Council refuse to licence my property?\nYes, if the property does not meet the conditions set out above and the landlord or manager is not a fit and proper person.\nWhat will happen then?\nIf a landlord fails to bring an HMO up to the required standard or fails to meet the fit and proper person criteria, the Council can issue an Interim Management Order (IMO), which allows it to step in and manage the property. The owner keeps their rights as an owner. This order can last for a year until suitable permanent management arrangements can be made. If the IMO expires and there has been no improvement, then the Council can issue a Final Management Order. This can last up to five years and can be renewed.\nCan I appeal?\nYou may appeal if the Council decides to:\nRefuse a licence\nGrant a licence with conditions\nRevoke a licence\nVary a licence\nRefuse to vary a licence\nYou must appeal to the First Tier Tribunal, normally within 28 days.\nTemporary exemption from licencing\nIf a landlord or person in control of a property intends to stop operating it as an HMO or reduces the numbers of occupants and can give evidence of this, they can apply  for a Temporary Exemption Notice. This lasts for a maximum of three months and ensures that a property in the process of being converted from an HMO does not need to be licenced. If the situation is not resolved, then a second Temporary Exemption Notice can be issued. When this expires, the property must be licenced, become subject to an Interim Management Order, or cease to be a HMO.\nAre there any other penalties?\nIt is an offence if the landlord or person in control of the property:\nFails to apply for a licence for a licensable property; or\nAllows a property to be occupied by more people than are permitted under the licence\nA fine of up to £30,000 may be imposed. In addition, breaking any of the licence conditions can result in fines of up to £5,000.\nRent repayment orders\nA tenant living in a property that should have been licenced, but was not, can apply to the First Tier Tribunal to claim back any rent they have paid during the unlicensed period (up to a limit of 12 months).  Councils can also reclaim any housing benefit that has been paid during the time the property was without a licence.\nIt will be an HMO if it is one of the following:\nIS MY PROPERTY A HMO?\nIt will be a HMO if it is one of the following:\nHousing Act 2004 section and schedule numbers\nA shared house lived in by people who belong to more than one family* and who share one or more facilities**\nS254(2)\n(The ‘standard test’)\nA house in bedsits lived in by people who belong to more than one family* and who share one or more facilities**\nS254(4)\n(The ‘converted building test’)\nAn individual flat lived in by people who belong to more than one family* and who share one or more facilities**\nS254(3)\n(the ‘self-contained flat test’)\nA building of self-contained flats that do not meet 1991 Building Regulation Standards.\nExemptions:\nIf it is occupied by only two people\nIf it is occupied by the owner (and their family if any) and one or two lodgers\nIf it is occupied by a religious community\nIf the occupiers have their main residence elsewhere***\nIf no one in the property is required to pay rent\nIf the owner or manager is a public body\nIf the owner or manager is an educational institution\nA building of self-contained flats if two thirds or more of the flats are owner-occupied\nIf the property is part of a guest house or hotel (unless an ‘HMO Declaration’ is made)\nSch 14, 7\nSch 14, 6(c)\nSch. 14, 5\nS259, S254(2)(e)\nSch. 14, 2\nSch. 14, 4\nS257(2)(b)\n(s255(1))\nExemptions:\nIf the whole property is in self-contained flats.\nIf the basement is in commercial use and there are only two residential storeys above.\n*Family – husband, wife, co-habitee, child, step-child, foster-child, grandchild, parent, step-parent, foster-parent, grandparent, brother, half-brother, sister, half-sister, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, cousin.\n**Facilities – basic amenities: wc, wash hand basin, shower, bath: cooking facilities.\n***Accommodation use by full-time students while they are studying is taken to be their main residence.\nS258\nS254(8)\nS259(2)(a)",

    "text": "Failure to apply for a licence\nIt's a serious offence for a person having control or managing a licensable HMO to do so without a licence and without reasonable excuse. If you’re found guilty, the court can impose an unlimited fine. You may also have to pay back any rent you received during the time the property was being let but wasn’t licenced.\nWe will give the person responsible adequate opportunities to apply for a licence before we take legal action. In most cases, we will write to you inviting you to apply. This usually gives you 28 days. In some cases, this could be less, for example, if the tenant wishes to apply for a rent repayment order.\nWe will then send you a reminder letter if you do not respond. Failure to reply to this may mean that we will have to inspect the property to confirm it is licensable.\nIf we find that lack of proper management standards has put the health and safety of the occupiers at serious risk, we may take legal action without giving you further opportunity to apply. This is based on widespread publicity regarding HMO licensing,and a reasonable expectation that anyone renting out a HMO property mist also adhere to the appropriate standards and the law.\nEven if you submit an application after we take legal action but before the case comes to court, it will not be regarded as a reason to withdraw proceedings; however, it may be regarded by the Court as a mitigating factor.\nPermitting excess occupation\nThe maximum number of occupants that can live in a HMO property at any one time is agreed when we issue the licence. It is against the law to knowingly rent out a licensed HMO property to more people than agreed and is an offence punishable by an unlimited fine.\nIf the licence holder was not aware, for example, if the tenants made the arrangement without the knowledge of the licence holder, we will bring it to their attention and will give them 28 days to take appropriate action, that is, to ensure the additional occupants permanently leave the HMO during that period.\nBreach of licence conditions\nBy law, it is an offence punishable by an unlimited fine if the licence holder fails without reasonable excuse to comply with any condition of the licence.\nSerious or repeated breaches of licence conditions may also result in revocation of the licence. Legal proceedings will be considered in all cases where a licence is revoked on these grounds.\nIncomplete applications\nApplicants who have failed to provide the full details required to make their application valid will be given adequate opportunity to provide the missing information or documentation.\nWe will write to you requesting the missing information or documentation to be provided within 14 days. Failing to respond to this letter will result in the application become ineffective.\nContinued failure to cooperate may be regarded as an overall failure to apply for a licence and we may take legal action.",

Jacob completed his journey to join us, and we're excited to have him on board.\nA Message from Citrus\nAt Citrus, the success of our apprentices is a team effort. If you have the opportunity to work with an apprentice, make it count! Offer them diverse experiences and guidance. Our apprentices have the potential to become some of our best employees, with support from Citrus colleagues like you.\nLivv Housing\nClaudia's Story\nClaudia is our Customer Insight Apprentice at Livv Housing. She shares, \"Before my apprenticeship, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. At Livv, I've explored different areas within my department, giving me a clearer direction.\"\nClaudia joined in September 2021 and has been thriving at Livv. She learns something new every day and values the supportive and welcoming atmosphere.\nNiall's Story\nNiall Walsh serves as an Assistant Property Manager at Livv Housing. He joined as an Apprentice Site Manager in 2018 at the age of 19, following his preference for hands-on work.\nAfter 18 months, he earned the role of Assistant Property Manager, a testament to the growth he achieved through his apprenticeship journey.\nSteven's Story\nSteven, a Finance Advisor – Property at Livv Housing, reflects on his apprenticeship journey. \"My apprenticeship not only developed my job skills but also enhanced crucial life skills like communication, time management, and teamwork. My overall confidence has grown too.\"\nHe believes apprenticeships are vital for young people, allowing them to transfer skills to their roles and daily life.\nPaul's Story\nPaul is our Electrical Apprentice at Livv Housing. He shares, \"I'm thoroughly enjoying my apprenticeship, especially learning the fundamentals of becoming an Electrician. Every day brings something new.\"\nAlongside the monthly support he receives from Knowsley Apprentice, Paul appreciates the welcoming team at Livv, who've made him feel like part of the family.\nMandy Manning, Learning & Development Manager\nMandy Manning, Learning & Development Manager at Livv Housing Group, emphasises their partnership with The Knowsley Apprentice, which has been key resource for nearly 15 years.\nLivv's apprenticeships give local young people with the opportunity to learn while earning, developing essential skills, knowledge, and confidence. These apprenticeships have paved the way for over 170 young people to kickstart their careers.\nMandy is proud of the success rate of their apprenticeships, with many employees advancing from apprentices to leadership roles. She believes that Knowsley Apprentice's partnership is crucial in offering local youth alternative paths to education and work, eliminating the need to travel outside the borough for opportunities.\nSteven A Hunt and Associates\n\"Last year, we had the privilege of participating in the Knowsley Apprenticeship scheme to hire a Junior Design Engineer. Thanks to this programme, we welcomed Thomas, who is now in his first year at LJMU, pursuing a Building Services Design Engineer Degree Apprenticeship.\"\n\"We greatly appreciate the support from Mandy, KMBC Young Persons Mentor. She not only promoted our vacancy in the Knowsley area but also among the young people she was assisting. This, along with an advert on the National Apprenticeship website, helped us find the right candidate.\"\n\"Knowing that the candidates referred by Mandy possessed the necessary attributes and qualifications for consideration was valuable. Equally important was the advice and guidance they received on essential employability skills.\"\n\"In addition to national government funding, the Knowsley financial incentive package proved extremely useful, especially for a smaller employer like us. It aided in covering training and mentoring expenses once Thomas joined our team.\"\n\"We appreciate that Mandy continues to monitor Thomas's progress, providing an external perspective that can help him feel comfortable in sharing any concerns.\"\nSt Albert's Catholic Primary School\nLisa Jewell, the School's Business Manager, shares, \"We decided to hire an apprentice for our school office, offering a young person the chance to secure a full-time job where they can learn and earn while bringing fresh ideas to our workplace.\"\n\"The Knowsley Apprentice Team has been helpful throughout the advertising and interviewing process, providing ongoing support for both us and our apprentice.\"",

    "text": "What is animal licencing\nAnimal licencing is a system that requires people to obtain a licence from their local council before they can keep certain types of animals. This includes wild, dangerous, or exotic animals, as well as certain types of domestic animals, such as dogs and cats.\nWhy animal licencing is important\nThere are a number of reasons why animal licencing is important.\nFirst, it helps to ensure that animals are kept in safe and humane conditions. As a local council we have a duty to inspect licenced premises and to ensure that animals are being properly cared for. If we find that an animal is not being kept in a suitable environment, we can take steps to protect the animal, such as requiring the owner to make improvements or even removing the animal from their care.\nSecond, animal licencing helps to prevent the spread of disease. Licenced premises are required to maintain high standards of hygiene and to ensure that their animals are vaccinated against common diseases. This helps to protect both public health and animal health.\nThird, animal licencing helps to reduce the number of unwanted animals. When people have to pay for a licence to keep an animal, they are more likely to think carefully about whether they are prepared to make a long-term commitment to the animal. This can help to reduce the number of animals that end up in shelters or on the streets.\nAnimal activities that require an animal licence\nHere is a list of animal activities that require an animal licence in the UK:\nSelling animals as pets\nProviding or arranging provision of boarding for cats or dogs\nHiring out horses\nDog breeding\nKeeping or training animals for exhibition\nIf you are unsure whether you need an animal licence for a particular activity, you should contact us.\nThis list is not exhaustive and there may be other activities that require an animal licence depending on the specific circumstances.\nEnvironmental Health - Who to contact\nWho to contact\nEnvironmental Health\nSend us a message\n0151 443 4712",

Park homes are subject to licensing by the local council, which ensures that the safety and welfare of residents is safeguarded.\nThe council can use the licensing process to set standards for the park and its facilities, such as the condition of the roads, the provision of services, and the safety of the homes. The council can also require the park owner to make any necessary alterations to the park or its facilities, subject to prior approval.\nIn addition to licensing, some developments on park home sites may also require planning permission from the local council.

We also regulate gaming and gaming machines on alcohol-licensed premises.\nIn addition, we grant permits to family entertainment centres to use certain lower-stake gaming machines and grant permits for prize gaming. We also look at occasional use notices for betting at tracks.\nFinally, we register small societies' lotteries.\nThe Gambling Act 2005 states that (except in the case of tracks) only people who hold or have applied for an operating licence from the Gambling Commission may apply to the council's licensing authority for a premises licence.\nKnowsley Council Gambling Policy\nKnowsley Council has approved a new gambling policy for 2025-27, which came into effect on 1 January 2025.\nThe policy outlines the council's approach to licensing gambling premises and promoting responsible gambling. It is designed to protect children and vulnerable people from the harmful effects of gambling and to prevent gambling from being associated with crime or disorder.\nThe Gambling Commission’s website\nalso provides a wealth of further information about the Gambling Act legislative provisions.\nDocument\nKnowsley Gambling Policy 2025 - 2027.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n925.03KB\n)\nHow to apply\nFor further information about gambling-related licences and how to apply, contact the Licensing Section by calling 0151 443 2300 or emailing\nlicensing@knowsley.gov.uk",

The oversubscription criteria for each school are different, but they typically give priority to children who live closest to the school, children who are looked after by the local authority, and children who have siblings already attending the school.\nThe Knowsley schools and academies listed below were oversubscribed at the point of the initial allocation of places for on-time applications.\n2024 allocation detail dates\nOversubscribed secondary schools/academies\n1st March 2024\nDocument\nAll Saints - Oversubscription Breakdown.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n90.49KB\n)\nDocument\nHalewood - Oversubscription Breakdown.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n84.58KB\n)\nDocument\nKirkby High - Oversubscription Breakdown.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n83.73KB\n)\nDocument\nLDA - Oversubscription Breakdown.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n89.58KB\n)\nOversubscribed primary schools/academies\nDocument\nBlacklow Brow Primary School.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n74.64KB\n)\nDocument\nCronton CE Primary School .pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n81.25KB\n)\nDocument\nKirkby CE Primary School.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n77.24KB\n)\nDocument\nMalvern Primary School.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n54.11KB\n)\nDocument\nMillbrook Primary School.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n55.47KB\n)\nDocument\nPrescot Primary School.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n56KB\n)\nDocument\nRoby Park Primary School.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n54.44KB\n)\nDocument\nSt Anne's Catholic Primary School.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n97.46KB\n)\nDocument\nSt Joseph the Worker Catholic Primary School.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n59.31KB\n)\nDocument\nSt Brigids Catholic Primary School.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n61.31KB\n)\nDocument\nSt Joseph's Catholic Primary School.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n81.1KB\n)\nA full copy of the school admission policy/arrangements can be found at\nhere\n.\nContact\nEmail\nschooladmissions@knowsley.gov.uk\nTelephone\nWe are available by phone Monday to Friday, 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM.

If you want your child to be considered under these criteria, you will need to complete a supplementary information form (SIF).\nThe common application form (CAF) does not always gather all the information that individual schools need to apply their oversubscription criteria.

This information helps the school to assess your child's application fairly and accurately.\nKnowsley Catholic and Church of England schools typically have an SIF that applicants must complete if they want their application to be considered under certain faith criteria. You can get these forms directly from the schools or download them from the Knowsley Council website.\nIf you are applying to a school that has an SIF, it is important to read the form carefully and complete it fully and accurately. You should also submit the SIF to the school by the deadline.\nIf you have any questions about SIFs, please contact the schools you are interested in applying to.\nHere are some additional tips for completing SIFs:\nBe honest and accurate in your responses.\nProvide any supporting documentation that is requested, such as a copy of your child's baptismal certificate or a letter from a religious leader.\nIf you are unsure about how to complete a question, contact the school for assistance.\nBy completing SIFs accurately and on time, you can help to ensure that your child's application is given full consideration.\nSupplementary Information Forms\nAttachment\nDocument\nSecondary-Catholic-SIF-2024-25.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n100.02KB\n)\nDocument\nPrimary-Catholic-SIF-2024-25.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n104.75KB\n)\nDocument\nCronton-CE-SIF-2024-25.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n113.96KB\n)\nDocument\nHalewood CE SIF 2025-26.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n121.17KB\n)\nDocument\nHuyton-with-Roby-SIF-2024-25.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n62.2KB\n)\nDocument\nKirkby-CE-SIF-2024-25.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n280.78KB\n)\nDocument\nSt-Mary-and-St-Paul-s-SIF-2024-25.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n92.1KB\n)",

    "text": "Knowsley’s Education Service believe that, in most cases, the best place to educate a child is in school. However, the Service acknowledges that parents have the right to elect to educate their child or children at home per Section 7 of the 1996 Education Act. Home-based education is the “otherwise” part of the act, and some parents choose to do this because they judge it as the best way to carry out their duty to educate their child.\nParents need to be fully informed when deciding to remove their child from a school’s roll and to provide home education. There are many big decisions to consider and there is a need to appreciate what a child would no longer have access to if they are no longer on the roll of a school. One of the most important implications for electing to home educate is that all the financial responsibility for your child(ren) 's learning is yours. Unfortunately, there is no funding available from within the Council to support your child’s education and exams unless they are on a school roll. The cost of books, equipment, educational visits and any costs for a tutor, if required, will be the responsibility of you, the parent.\nKnowsley’s Elective Home Education policy\naims to help parents understand what may be involved if they are thinking of educating their child in this way. We hope it will help you to consider all the implications of Elective Home Education, explain the law as it applies to you and the Council, and how this works in Knowsley. In addition, there is also the\nDfE’s Elective Home Education: guide for parents\nwhich provides information on the national guidance.\nFor more information, please call 0151 443 5177, or e-mail\nElectiveHome.Education@knowsley.gov.uk\n.\nResources\nThe Council recognise that much of the elective home education children and young people engage with can be heavily supported through online resources, activities and web pages. This can be a rich and valuable resource.\nIt is therefore important that parents, who chose to electively home educate their children and utilise the internet to support this, take every step to safeguard their children and keep them safe when they are online.\nAs EHE parents you can do this by ensuring all necessary parental controls are in place and that steps have been taken to ensure that you educate your child about how to keep safe online.\nThe following resources are designed to support young people, adults and parents/carers to keep everyone safe and to provide information  on a variety of safeguarding topics and ways to prevent young people from being contacted in their own homes, on the internet, and exploited in a range of ways.\nKeeping children safe online | NSPCC\nOnline safety and advice resources\nOnline Safety Act: explainer - GOV.U",

Some of the agencies represented in the MASH are Adult Social Care, Children’s Social Care, Health, Housing and the Police. Agencies work together with the Early Help Team and Children’s Social Care to provide information about concerns raised and help make the best decisions around a child’s welfare and safety.\nThe MASH provides a ‘first point of contact’ for Early Help and Children’s Social Care (CSC), enabling members of the public and professionals to raise concerns about the safety and welfare of Children. This may include Children identified as needing support or at risk of suffering abuse.\nKnowsley MASH operates between 9.00 am to 5.00 pm Monday to Friday and can be contacted via\nemail\nor by dialling 0151 443 2600.\nMembers of the public should always make contact by telephone.\nIf you contact MASH by telephone, you will be asked a series of questions when making a referral to ensure as much information as possible can be gained to support what level of need is identified and what action is required by whom.\nProfessionals who work with children and who need to raise a concern should use the\nMulti-agency Referral Form (MARF)\n. The form should be emailed to the MASH team when it is completed. If there is any sense of urgency regarding the concern being raised, the form should be sent, followed by a phone call to MASH to highlight the urgency of the case. If you need help in respect of filling in the form, you can also give the MASH a call for advice.\nThere is no pre-requisite to complete an Early Help Assessment (EHA) before referring to Children’s Social Care. However, if the concerns do not require social work interventions, it will be expected that support is provided to the family via an Early Help Assessment. If an EHA has been completed at the point of referral, this should be sent with the\nMARF\nor sent separately if the referral is received via a telephone call.\nAt all other times, the Emergency Duty Team (EDT) is the ‘first point of contact’ for Children’s Social Care.\nEDT can be contacted using the same number as the MASH – 0151 443 2600.\nEDT will only respond to Emergencies that cannot wait until the next working day. This is usually circumstances where there are immediate concerns regarding the welfare or safety of children, or there is a risk of family breakdown and the child being placed in care.\nPlease note if you believe a child or young person is at immediate risk of harm, you should contact the police urgently.",

    "text": "Private fostering is when a child under 16 (or under 18 if disabled) lives with someone who is not a close relative for 28 days or more. This might be a friend, a great aunt, a cousin or someone else known to the child. A close relative is defined as a grandparent, aunt, uncle, brother or step-parent by marriage. Many parents who have arranged for someone else to care for their child don’t realise that they have entered into a private fostering arrangement when they have made informal arrangements with friends or extended family.\nTo keep vulnerable children safe and support families, by law, parents and carers must notify their local authority if they have a private fostering arrangement in place. There are many reasons why children are privately fostered. Such examples include:\nparental ill health children or young people from overseas who visit this country for education or health care reasons\nchildren or young people who are living with a friend/boyfriend/girlfriend’s family as a result of parental separation, divorce or arguments at home\nchildren or young people whose parents work or study long or anti-social hours\nchildren or teenagers on school holiday exchanges that last more than 28 days\nchildren or teenagers on sports or music sponsorships live away from their families. A parent or an agency, such as a college or sports academy, would normally make such an arrangement\nEven though this is a private arrangement, the law says that the local authority must ensure your child is safe and well cared for.\nIf you are thinking of placing your child in a private fostering arrangement, you must tell the local authority at least six weeks beforehand or, in case of an emergency placement, within 48 hours of the placement beginning.\nIf the arrangement has already started, you must contact Knowsley Borough Council immediately on 0151 443 2929.\nSee leaflets for more information:\nDocument\nPrivate Fostering - A Guide for parents and carers_.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n356.58KB\n)\nDocument\nPrivate Fostering - Children YP.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n215.73KB\n)",

CSC has received two awards from IIC and will continue to conduct external assessments annually to keep participation high on the agenda.  This has supported us to focus more on a ‘you said, we did’ approach where we listen to our children, take on board their experiences, and react in response to their thoughts, wishes and feelings.\nHere are some examples of how we have responded to what children have said:\nThe Corporate Parenting Board works closely with Children’s Social Care to ensure targets set out in the Corporate Parenting Plan are met. It engages feedback from MADE Together to help improve the delivery of services and monitors a ‘you said, we did’ action plan linked to what children have asked decision-makers to consider.\nMADE Together is a new shadow board to the Corporate Parenting Board which brings together decision-makers, MADE and the care experienced people forum to hold council services to account.  This will help improve the care experiences of all cared-for children and the support offered for care-experienced people.\nMADE Together meets bi-annually with regular Keep in Touch (KIT) meetings with directors, heads of service and commissioned services to progress their agenda. (March and September)\nThe Corporate Parenting Board support the MADE agenda to reach other decision makers and related partners to progress their agenda, such as links with the health and wellbeing board and the Knowsley safeguarding children’s partnership.\nCommissioned service and voluntary and community service across Knowsley and beyond, link with the participation officer, MADE, young advisors from Knowsley Safeguarding Children Partnership (KSCP) and care experienced people to build on offers of support, including the\nLocal Offer for Care Experienced People\n, mental health support services and projects, creative arts projects, access to leisure and support for young parents.",

    "text": "About Safeguarding Adults Review (SAR)\nSafeguarding Adult Boards have a legal duty to coordinate Safeguarding Adult Reviews (SARs) as outlined under the Care Act 2014.\nA SAR is a multi-agency review process which seeks to determine what relevant agencies and individuals involved could have done differently that could have prevented harm or a death from taking place.\nThe purpose of a SAR is not to blame, it is to promote effective learning and improvement to prevent future deaths or serious harm occurring again.\nThe Knowsley arrangements for the consideration of Safeguarding Adult Review (SAR) referrals are through a collaboration between relevant organisations in the Local Authority areas, Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens and Wirral, called the Merseyside Safeguarding Adult Review Group (MSARG).\nKnowsley SAR referrals are directed to MSARG to consider and establish if the referral meets the criteria for a SAR. Recommendations are then made to the relevant Safeguarding Adult Board Chair about whether a SAR or other type of review should be carried out.\nCriteria for conducting a Safeguarding Adult Review\nSection 44 of the Care Act (2014) states that the Safeguarding Adult Board (SAB) must arrange a SAR when an adult with needs for care and support (even if the local authority has not been meeting any of those needs) if:\nthere is reasonable cause for concern about how the SAB, members of it or other persons with relevant functions worked together to safeguard the adult, and\nthe adult has died, and\nthe SAB knows or suspects that the death resulted from abuse or neglect (whether it knew about or suspected the abuse or neglect before the adult died)\nOr\nthe adult is still alive, and the SAB knows or suspects that the adult has experienced serious abuse or neglect\nOrganisations involved\nThe Merseyside Safeguarding Adults Review Group (MSARG) is a collaboration between organisations in the Local Authority areas of Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens and Wirral.\nWhen SARs are conducted\nA Safeguarding Adults Board (SAB) must arrange a SAR when\nAn adult with needs for care and support has died, and the SAB knows or suspects that the death resulted from abuse or neglect, whether or not it knew about or suspected the abuse or neglect before the adult died.\nAn adult is still alive, and the SAB knows or suspects that the adult has experienced serious abuse or neglect.\nThere is reasonable cause for concern about how the SAB, its members, or other persons with relevant functions worked together to safeguard the adult and one of the above conditions is met.\nHow SARs work\nOnce a SAR has been commissioned, a team of independent reviewers will be appointed to carry out the review. The reviewers will gather evidence from a range of sources, such as interviews with people involved in the case, examination of records, and visits to relevant services.\nThe reviewers will then write a report which sets out their findings and recommendations. The report will be shared with all the agencies involved in the case and with the Safeguarding Adults Board.\nThe benefits of SARs\nSARs help to improve the way that agencies work together to safeguard adults. By learning from what happened in the past, agencies can identify and address any weaknesses in their practice. This can help to prevent similar tragedies from happening again.\nLearning from SARs in Knowsley\nThe Merseyside Safeguarding Adults Board (MSAB) coordinated a voluntary Safeguarding Adults Review (SAR) for Knowsley. The review report and action plan were agreed upon by MSAB, and the newly established Knowsley Safeguarding Adults Board took on the action plan to ensure that the actions were completed and the learning was shared.\nSAR referrals\nAnyone or any agency can make a referral to The Merseyside Safeguarding Adults Review Group if they believe that the situation meets the criteria.\nPlease download the referral form below and return it to\nSAR@Wirral.gov.uk\nMore information\nVisit the Knowsley\nSafeguarding Adult Reviews website\nfor more information.\nDocument\nMr-B-case-study-July-2023.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n163.34KB\n)\nDocument\nRisk Management Processes Final.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n281.44KB\n)\nReferral form download\nDocument\nSAR Referral Form.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n170.15KB\n)",

It can result from providing false information or failing to declare changes in circumstances.\nIt is sometimes considered a victimless crime, yet this could not be further from the truth.\nTypes of benefit fraud\nBenefit can be claimed fraudulently by:\nFailing to declare work - involves claimants receiving Housing Benefit or Council Tax Support but failing to declare their earned income.\nNon-disclosure of property, capital or income - the claimant does not tell us about all their income, savings, capital or property so that the amount of benefit they get is higher than it should be\nNon-disclosure of partner (living together as man and wife) - the claimant not telling us that they have a partner (who is often working) knowing that this would mean that they would not be entitled to benefit\nNon-declaration of non-dependants or sub-tenants - a claimant does not tell us about other adults living in the property to keep or increase their benefit entitlement\nFalse claims by homeowners - where the property owner falsely claims benefit, stating that they are paying rent for the property. They invent a fictitious landlord and use false rent books and tenancy agreements\nFalse address or failing to declare a change of address - the claimant is claiming benefit for an address where they do not live\nLandlord fraud – where a landlord continues to receive benefits paid directly to themselves when they know that the claimant has left the premises\nFictitious tenancies - where a tenancy is created between friends or family, where the property would not usually be rented, to obtain benefits to which they are not entitled",

But if one of you fails to pay, the other person is liable to pay the full amount.\nMarried and unmarried couples\nHusbands and wives and unmarried couples living together are liable to pay Council Tax even if only one of them owns or rents the property.  The bill will show all the names, although only one bill may be sent.\nEmpty homes discount\nFor unoccupied and unfurnished properties, a discount of 100% is available for one calendar month from the date that the property first became unoccupied and unfurnished. After this date, the full Council Tax charge becomes due.\nIf you buy or rent a property that is already empty and unfurnished, then the previous owner or landlord may have already been granted the discount, so you may not be eligible for the 1 month discount.\nProperties that require major repairs will be charged at the full Council Tax level from the date they become vacant.\nProperties which have been unoccupied and unfurnished in excess of two years will be subject to an additional premium charge of 100%. Properties which have been unoccupied and unfurnished for more than 5 years will be subject to a premium charge of 200%. Properties which have been unoccupied and unfurnished for more than 10 years will be subject to a premium charge of 300%.\nYou must notify us within 21 days if you believe that the premium charge does not apply.\nSecond home reductions\nCertain second homes are eligible for a 50% reduction on their Council Tax bill.\nThe council tax payer lives elsewhere in job-related accommodation specified by the terms and conditions of their contract, for example: caretakers, ministers of religion or members of the armed forces.  This does not apply to second homes that are rented because they are convenient for work.\nHomes that are pitches or moorings occupied by caravans or boats\nA planning restriction means you’re unable to occupy the property for at least 28 continuous days a year\nPlease contact us via online chat if you think you may qualify for any of these discounts.\nWhen the owner should pay the Council Tax\nThe owner, rather than the occupier, is liable to pay the Council Tax in the following special cases:\nHouses in multiple occupation, e.g. groups of bedsits which share washing and cooking facilities.\nCare and nursing homes together with some hostels.\nProperties occupied only be religious communities.\nSome second homes.\nSome vicarages.\nProperties occupied by asylum seekers.\nDepending on your circumstances and those who live with you, you may be entitled to a\nCouncil Tax discount or exemption\n.",

    "text": "In 2013, the Government implemented new rules. These rules state that you will receive housing benefit based on one bedroom for each person or couple living as part of the household. There are some exceptions.\nThe rules only apply to people of working age claiming housing benefit. They do not apply to pensioners who have reached the qualifying age for pension credit.\nChildren under 16 of the same gender are expected to share a bedroom.\nChildren under 10 are expected to share a bedroom regardless of their gender.\nA disabled tenant or partner needing a non-resident overnight carer will be allowed an extra room.\nExamples\nA couple with two girls aged five and 15 will be treated as needing two bedrooms. From April 2013, if they live in a three bedroom home their housing benefit will be reduced.\nA single parent with a seven year old boy and nine year old girl will be treated as needing two bedrooms. From April 2013, if they live in a three-bedroom home their housing benefit will be reduced.\nThe changes affect you if you are of working age and are treated as having at least one spare bedroom. This includes the following.\nSeparated parents who share the care of their children and who may have been allocated an extra bedroom for this. Under benefit rules, there must be just one ‘main carer’ for children – if you are not the main carer, your benefit will be reduced.\nCouples who don’t share the same bedroom – the second bedroom will be treated as a spare bedroom.\nFoster carers – the bedroom they use for any foster children will be treated as a spare bedroom. This is because foster children are not counted as part of the household for benefit purposes.\nIf you have one ‘spare’ bedroom, the rent we use to calculate your housing benefit reduced by 14%. This was to equal to about £12 a week (£624 a year).\nIf you have two or more ‘spare’ bedrooms, the rent we use to calculate your housing benefit reduced by 25%. This was equal to about £22 a week (£1,144 a year).\nWhat if your housing benefit payments don’t cover your rent\nIf you think your housing benefit will be reduced because you have one or more ‘spare’ bedrooms, you need to start planning for the change now.\nTo avoid falling into arrears, you will have to use other money to pay your landlord the shortfall. If you are worried you won’t be able to pay any shortfall in your rent, contact your landlord.",

The support is tailored to each case and can include help with family problems, mental health, mentoring, religious support, and more.\nPeople who are referred to Channel are not criminals, but they may be at risk of committing an offence if not supported.\nThe programme can provide training for staff in partner agencies (such as Education, Health, Prison, Probation, Youth Offending, Fire Service, Police etc) and key organisations within the private sector. The training facilitates organisations to identify individuals who may be at risk of supporting violent extremism and how to refer them for support.\nAn escalation process to strategic governance is in place for the Channel Panel. This process is publicised to panel members and partners.\nFor further details of this process please contact Lindsey Heaton Service Manager Quality Assurance Service, Chair of Channel Panel.\nContact details 07766780354.\nSupport for organisations and individuals to challenge extremist ideology\nMany people and groups want to actively work to change extremist ideology and uphold the values of tolerance, democracy, cohesion, equality, the rule of law, and freedom of speech. This is most powerful when it comes from within communities themselves. Knowsley Prevent Action Plan will identify and encourage community-based activities and projects to help this to happen.\nReport\nIf you see it, or suspect it, report it.\nIf you are worried about someone and think they may be at risk of getting involved in terrorism or extremism, you must complete the referral form below.\nDocument\nPrevent-Referral-Form-July-2022.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n49.7KB\n)\nOnce completed, email to both of the addresses below.\nKnowsleymash@knowsley.gov.uk\nprevent@merseyside.police.uk\nPlease provide as much information as you can.\nReport online\nYou can report online material promoting terrorism or extremism on the Government website.\nReport here\nTelephone\nIf you consider anything to be suspicious or connected with terrorism, contact the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321.\nIf you believe someone is at risk of radicalisation, call the Knowsley Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub on 0151 443 2600.\nIf there is an ongoing incident, contact the police on 999.",

    "text": "Illicit alcohol is alcohol that is produced or sold illegally.\nTypes of illicit alcohol\nCounterfeit alcohol\nThis is alcohol that is made to look like a genuine brand, but it is actually not. Counterfeit alcohol may contain hazardous substances, such as methanol.\nMethanol is a non-drinking alcohol substance that is used for industrial purposes only. It can be found in products like anti-freeze and paint remover.\nIf methanol is consumed it can lead to breathing difficulties, liver damage or even death.\nNon-duty paid alcohol\nThis is alcohol that has been smuggled into the country without paying the proper taxes. Non-duty paid alcohol although not counterfeit it is still illegal to buy or sell.\nHow to identify illicit alcohol\nUnfamiliar brand name\nIf you don't recognise the brand name, it's a good chance that the alcohol is illicit.\nLow price\nIllicit alcohol is often sold at a much lower price than genuine alcohol. This is because it doesn't have to pay the same taxes and doesn't have the same production costs.\nUnusual taste or smell\nIllicit alcohol may taste or smell different from genuine alcohol.\nLow quality labelling and packaging\nIllicit alcohol often has low quality labelling and packaging. This may include misspelled words, grammatical errors, or poor printing quality.\nNo 'UK Duty Paid' stamp\nGenuine alcohol in the UK will have a 'UK Duty Paid' stamp. If the alcohol you're buying doesn't have this stamp, it's likely to be illicit.\nForeign brand names\nIf the alcohol has a foreign brand name, it's important to check that it is being sold legally in the UK.\nNo manufacturer details\nGenuine alcohol will have the manufacturer's details on the label. If the alcohol you're buying doesn't have this information, it's likely to be illicit.\nWhere to buy alcohol safely\nOnly buy alcohol from reputable traders, such as licensed supermarkets and off-licenses.\nAvoid buying alcohol from residential properties, vehicles, or markets. This alcohol is more likely to be illicit.\nSelling illicit alcohol\nThe maximum sentence for selling illicit alcohol is ten years in prison. If you are convicted, the courts have the power to seize your assets, including jewellery and the family home.\nReport illicit alcohol\nAny information received about manufacturers, importers, distributors, businesses or individuals dealing in illegal alcohol products will be investigated by Trading Standards. Action will be taken against those found to be breaking the law and this can include prosecutions.\nWho to Contact\nKnowsley Council\nEmail us (\nTradingstandardsteam@knowsley.gov.uk\n)\nTelephone\n0151 443 4712\nCitizens Advice consumer helpline\n0808 223 1133\n. Lines are open Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm. Lines are closed on bank holidays.\nOur aim\nDisrupt and eliminate criminal organisations which deal in illegal and non-duty paid alcohol products.\nRaise awareness of the harmful effects of alcohol products on young people, peers and the Knowsley community.\nInvestigate and prosecute any person concerned in the sale or supply of alcohol products to any child.",

This includes cigarettes, hand-rolling tobacco, and niche products (such as blunts and Shisha).\nWhere does illicit tobacco come from\nSmuggled\nThese are generally legitimately-manufactured tobacco products which have evaded payment of tax by being illegally transported, distributed and sold.\nBootlegged, also known as ‘illicit whites’\nTobacco products which are purchased in a country with a low level of taxation and illegally brought into the UK, evading payment of tax.\nCounterfeit\nThese are illegally-manufactured tobacco products which are often made abroad, but sometimes in the UK. They are sold cheaply and tax free and vast profits are made throughout the supply chain.\nThe effects of illicit tobacco\nIllicit tobacco harms our local communities in many different ways\nIt damages local businesses by undercutting them with cheap prices.\nIt is often sold alongside drugs and other counterfeit goods, bringing criminal activity to the area.\nIt helps young people start smoking at an early age and discourages people from quitting.\nIt increases the risk of house fires, as illegal cigarettes do not meet the same safety standards as legitimate products.\nIt costs the NHS billions of pounds every year in treating smoking-related health conditions.\nIt brings criminal activity to the area, helping to fund crime and organised gangs.\nHow to identify illicit tobacco\nNo \"UK Duty Paid\" fiscal mark\nSpelling mistakes and/or altered logos\nUnfamiliar brands, labelling, or text\nPrice, if 20 cigarettes cost less than £3.50\nForeign or no health warnings/pictures\nWhere illicit tobacco is commonly sold\nIllicit tobacco is normally sold cheaply from places such as\nPubs\nSunbeds\nCar boot sales\nIce cream vans\nResidential homes\nWhere to buy legitimate tobacco products\nTo ensure you are purchasing legitimate tobacco products, always buy from a reputable retailer who is less likely to sell illicit tobacco.\nOur aim\nKnowsley Council is working with partners to\nDisrupt and eliminate criminal organisations which deal in illegal and non-duty paid tobacco products.\nAssist local agencies and other key partners to thoroughly investigate the importation and distribution of illegal and non-duty paid tobacco products.\nRaise awareness of the harmful effects of tobacco products on young people, peers, and the Knowsley community.\nInvestigate and prosecute any person concerned in the sale or supply of tobacco products to any child.\nSelling illicit tobacco\nDid you know that if your employees are involved with illegal tobacco sales at work, it is you who could face prosecution? Turning a blind eye is not an option. It is your responsibility to ensure that illegal tobacco sales are not taking place on your premises.\nThe sale of illegal tobacco products is a serious crime, and it can have a number of negative consequences for your business, including fines up to £5,000.\nReport illicit tobacco\nAny information received about manufacturers, importers, distributors, businesses or individuals dealing in illegal alcohol products will be investigated by Trading Standards. Action will be taken against those found to be breaking the law and this can include prosecutions.\nYou can report it anonymously to the Illegal Tobacco Helpline on\n0300 999 0000\nor online via the\nIllegal Tobacco: Keep it out website\n.\nWho to Contact\nKnowsley Council\nEmail us (\nTradingstandardsteam@knowsley.gov.uk\n)\nTelephone\n0151 443 4712\nCitizens Advice consumer helpline\n0808 223 1133\n.

Some forms of illness can take several days to cause illness after the initial infection and, therefore, it is not possible to attribute a particular food business without a confirmed diagnosis\nThe UK Health Security Agency will notify us if you submit a stool sample and an illness of concern is identified. We may contact you to ask you to complete a detailed health questionnaire.\nWe may choose not to investigate your complaint if\nYou have not provided a stool sample and do not have a confirmed diagnosis\nYour complaint is not about food safety\nYour complaint is about a food business that is not in Knowsley\nMake a complaint\nContact\nEnvironmental Health Service\nEmail\nenvironmentalhealth@knowsley.gov.uk",

The scheme also encourages businesses to maintain high hygiene standards.\nHow the scheme works\nFood hygiene ratings are based on inspections conducted by Environmental Health Officers. The ratings are based on three factors:\nFood safety practices and procedures\nStructure and cleaning\nConfidence in management\nBusinesses included in the scheme\nOnly businesses that directly supply the public with food are included in the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme. Examples of such businesses include most food shops, cafes, restaurants, takeaways, and pubs.\nRating system\nFood hygiene ratings range from 5 (Very good) to 0 (Urgent improvement required). Scores are published on the national Food Hygiene Website. Businesses are also provided with a sticker outlining their rating.\nDisplaying ratings\nWhile it is not currently a legal requirement to display a food hygiene rating sticker in England, businesses are encouraged to do so. If a food business does display a rating sticker, it must display the most recent hygiene rating.\nRight to appeal\nBusinesses have the right to appeal against a food hygiene rating if they disagree with it.\nThey are encouraged to first discuss the rating informally with the inspecting officer.\nIf the business is still unsatisfied, they can lodge a formal appeal within 21 days of being informed of the rating.\nRight to reply\nBusiness owners or managers also have a \"right to reply.\"\nThis means they can submit an explanation of how the business has improved hygiene or to describe any unusual circumstances at the time of the inspection.\nThe business's right to reply will be published online by the Council alongside the business's hygiene rating.\nRequest for reinspection\nBusinesses can request a reinspection if they have made significant improvements to their hygiene standards. There is a charge for this service.\nPlease note that if standards have deteriorated, the rating can go down.\nAdditional information\nFor more information about the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme, please visit the\nFood Standards Agency website\n.\nDocuments\nAppeal form\nDocument\nFood-Hygiene-Appeal-Form (1).doc\n(\nDOC\n,\n170KB\n)\nRight to reply form\nDocument\nFood-Hygiene-Right-of-Reply-(1).doc\n(\nDOC\n,\n176KB\n)\nReturn to\nEnvironmental Health Service\nKnowsley Council\n2nd Floor\nMunicipal Building\nArchway Road\nHuyton\nKnowsley\nL36 9YU",

    "text": "Japanese knotweed, also known as Fallopia japonica, is an invasive plant that spreads rapidly and crowds out other native vegetation. It can grow almost anywhere, including gardens, parks, and roadsides.\nThis aggressive plant can cause significant damage, including\nLoss of native plant species\nStructural damage\nLand value reduction\nMortgage difficulties\nRecognising Japanese knotweed\nHere are key features to help identify Japanese knotweed:\nLarge, green, shovel-shaped leaves\nJapanese knotweed leaves are distinctively large and shaped like shovels. They are typically 10-15 centimetres long and have a smooth, glossy surface.\nVertical bamboo-like stems\nThe plant's stems are hollow and can grow up to 3 meters tall. They are typically green but may turn red or purple in autumn.\nWhite flowers\nJapanese knotweed produces white flowers in late summer or early autumn. The flowers form small clusters along the stems.\nControlling Japanese knotweed\nControlling Japanese knotweed can be challenging as it is an invasive species of plant which spreads rapidly and overwhelms other plants. It is crucial to prevent the plant from spreading to other areas.\nLandowner responsibility\nThe landowner is responsible for controlling Japanese knotweed on their property. This includes preventing the plant from spreading to neighbouring lands or public spaces.\nConsult landowners\nIf you find Japanese knotweed on private land, such as a neighbour's property or a construction site, contact the landowner first. If no action is taken, report the issue to the Environmental Health department.\nPublic or council-owned land\nFor Japanese knotweed on public or council-owned land, contact the Environmental Sustainability Service.\nProper disposal\nDo not remove or dispose of Japanese knotweed on your own, putting it in your bin or local waste centre is an offence. Contact a specialist contractor for proper removal and disposal.\nIntentionally spreading Japanese knotweed is an offence. Improper disposal of the plant can also lead to legal consequences.\nMore information\nFor more information on Japanese knotweed, including identification, control methods, and legal obligations, visit\nGov.uk.\nContact\nEnvironmental Health\nAddress\n2nd Floor\nMunicipal Building\nArchway Road\nHuyton\nL36 9FB\nTelephone\n0151 443 4712\nEmail\nenvironmentalhealth@knowsley.gov.uk\nThe Environmental Sustainability Service\nEmail\ness.enquiries@knowsley.gov.uk",

They may visit your property to witness the noise or install noise monitoring equipment.

Factors that are considered when determining if a noise is a statutory nuisance include the frequency and duration of the noise, the context (such as the location, other noise sources nearby, and the time of day), the volume, and any tonal elements of the noise.\nTo find out more about how to log a noise complaint please visit out\nNoise complaints page.\nSmoke and fumes\nIt is illegal to burn certain materials, such as household waste, rubber, painted or treated wood, furniture, tires, and plastic.\nLight\nLight nuisance is caused by artificial light emitted from premises. To be a nuisance, the light must be disturbing to your life, occur frequently, occur at a time of day when it is not expected, and be caused by malicious or ordinary behaviour.\nUnpleasant odours\nWe deal with complaints of smells which cause a nuisance in your home as a result of trade, industrial or agricultural activities.\nOvergrown/rubbish in garden\nIf your neighbour lets rubbish build up on their land, or allows their garden to become overgrown, it could cause problems that affect you.\nPlease note that we cannot take action against smells from a domestic property unless it is due to a build-up of waste at that property. Smells from land or muck spreading are usually temporary and pose little risk to health. We would not investigate a complaint about land spreading unless it became a frequent occurrence.\nWhat you can do\nBefore you contact Environmental Health, we would advise you to discuss the problem with your neighbour. Often, they simply do not realise they are causing a problem.\nIn most instances, light pollution being the exception, we will request that you complete a nuisance log sheet.\nGuidance on how to complete the sheets and for how long can be found on the log sheet.

    "text": "Dog fouling is a crime\nIt is illegal to let your dog foul in a public place without cleaning it up. This is known as dog fouling and it is an act of environmental anti-social behaviour.\nThe consequences of dog fouling\nDog fouling is unpleasant and can cause serious illness, such as blindness, to people through an infection called Toxocariasis. This infection is caused by worms found in dogs' intestines.\nEnforcement officers patrol the Borough and issue Fixed Penalty Notices to people who fail to clean up after their dogs. If you are caught not cleaning up after your dog, you could be issued with a £100 Fixed Penalty Notice. If you do not pay the Fixed Penalty Notice, you could be prosecuted in a magistrate's court.\nWhat you can do\nIf you are a dog owner or walker, please always carry a bag when you walk your dog. Bag up your dog waste securely (ideally double bag it) and dispose of it in any public litter bin. You can report a damaged or overflowing bin online.\nIf you have a garden, train your dog to do its mess there and make sure you clean it up and put it in your red waste bin straight away. Never put animal mess in your blue or grey waste bins.\nNever let your dog go outside to do its mess alone.\nMore information\nIf you are in charge of a dog at the time it fouls, you are responsible for cleaning up after it. Even if you don't know your dog has fouled, or don't have a poop scoop, it is no excuse. You should always make sure to bring along the means to clean up after your dog when you take it outside.\nOnce you have cleaned up the dog waste, you can put it in any ordinary litter bin, as long as it is securely wrapped. If there is no bin available, take the waste home and dispose of it in your red waste bin.\nBy cleaning up after your dog, you are acting as a responsible owner and protecting children's health and the environment.\nHow to report dog fouling\nIf you see someone letting their dog foul without cleaning it up, or you know of an area that needs to be patrolled, please report it to us. You can do this by clicking on the link at the bottom of this page.\nIf you can provide information about the person responsible, such as their name and address, we may contact you to obtain further evidence as part of our investigation.\nReport here",

Memorials remain the property and responsibility of registered grave owners, who are required to ensure their memorial is safe. Should owners find their memorials are unsafe, repairs should be carried out by a monumental mason.\nOpening times\nCemeteries and car parks are always open to the public.

    "text": "Services\nOur ground maintenance service runs from March to October each year and provide the following:\nGrass cutting\nTall grass maintenance\nWeed control\nHedges and shrubbery\nGrass cutting\nWe cut the grass on verges in Knowsley every two weeks from March to October, unless the weather is bad. We cut a total of 3.8 million square meters of grass per year, which is the same as 4,784 football pitches.\nWe don't remove the grass clippings, as they put nutrients back into the soil and help the grass grow healthy. But we do remove the clippings from footpaths and the highway for safety reasons.\nHigh speed roads are maintained up to three times per year.\nA580 – East Lancashire Road\nM62\nA562 – Speke to Widnes Road\nA5300 – Knowsley Expressway\nTarbock Island – M62 Junction 6\nStrategic roads are maintained six times per year.\nA57 – Liverpool Road\nA58 – Prescot Bypass\nA506 – Valley Road\nA5207 – Moorgate Road\nA5208 – South Boundary Road / Coopers Lane\nB5199 – Roby Road / Archway Road\nRural roads are maintained twice per year.\nNetherley Road\nCronton Road\nGreensbridge Lane\nCartbridge Lane\nLower Road\nGerrards Lane\nWater Lane\nPrescot Road\nStockswell Road\nCross Hillocks Road\nAlder Lane\nPingwood Lane\nNorth Perimeter Road\nTall grass areas\nKnowsley Council has created tall grass areas along some roadside verges.\nAs part of the council's Climate Emergency Declaration, which committed to creating more natural green spaces in the borough, a small number of natural tall grass sites have been created along roadside verges. See a list of all tall grass areas in the borough.\nView a list of all tall grass areas in the borough\n.\nWeed control\nWe spray the borough's highways and footways twice a year to control weeds.\nWe use approved chemicals, well-maintained equipment, and take account of weather conditions to protect the environment. We do not spray during rain or wind to prevent overspray.\nWeeds start to die off within 7-10 days of being sprayed with herbicide. We then return to scrape out and remove the dead vegetation.\nWinter hedge and shrubbery maintenance\nWe maintain council-owned hedges and shrubs once a year during the winter, from November to February. This includes scheduled maintenance of ornamental and field hedges, cutting back shrubbery, and extensive litter clearance in hard-to-reach areas. We avoid the bird nesting season, from February to August, in line with the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.\nPrivately owned land\nWe do not maintain privately owned land unless we have a service level agreement with the landowner. If you live in an area with a registered social landlord, such as Livv Housing Group or Riverside Housing, they are responsible for the maintenance of their sites.",

By separating your food waste, you'll be playing a vital role in building a more sustainable future for our community. This new service makes it easier than ever to dispose of food scraps responsibly, ensuring they're turned into something beneficial rather than ending up in general waste.\nWe understand you may have questions about what can and can't be included, how to store your food waste, and the collection schedule. To help you get started, we've compiled a comprehensive\nFrequently Asked Questions\n. You'll find all the information you need there for the time being, including the types of food waste accepted.\nPlease take a moment to review the FAQ's to ensure a smooth transition to this new service. More information about specific collection dates and food waste containers will be announced in the near future, so please keep your eyes open for updates.\nWe appreciate your cooperation and commitment to making our region greener!",

    "text": "Approved lists of suppliers\nThe Council does not maintain an approved list of suppliers. All potential suppliers are those who register an interest on the Chest, which allows the councils to advertise their tender opportunities to the widest possible audience of interested suppliers. It is up to you, as a supplier, to ensure that your company profile on\nthe Chest\nreflects the type of contract that you would be interested in tendering for.\nThere are some opportunities to join Dynamic Purchasing Systems, the modern equivalent of 'approved lists of suppliers', but these are open and transparent. These opportunities are primarily in the field of health and social care.\nFinding tenders\nYou can find out when contracts are being tendered by the Council by registering on\nthe Chest\n. Registration is simple and free, and you can browse opportunities for other Contracting Authorities across NW England and further afield.\nProviding information\nYou will need to provide information when you submit a tender or register an interest in an advertised opportunity. This information is required by law and will be used to assess your bid. The Council will only ever ask for the information that is needed.\nWinning council work\nThe Council aims to make contracts accessible to Small/Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs), the Voluntary & Community Sector (VCSEs), and local businesses of any size. The Council guarantees a fair tender process, with each application treated equally and transparently.\nProcurement process\nThe procurement process can take some time due to legal requirements set by the\nPublic Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCRs 2015)\nand the need to ensure that all bids are assessed fairly. The Council will try to keep bidders fully informed and will publish the individual procurement timescale in its tender documentation.\nBenefits of working with the Council\nThe Council guarantees a fair tender process, with each application treated equally and transparently. The Council has a prompt invoice payment policy and is a reliable customer. Working with public sector buyers also provides a track record to help you win work with other organisations, and where appropriate, the Council will provide references for you to use.\nTender pricing\nIn the majority of cases, your submitted price will be your final price. You should tender your best price and ensure it is sustainable for you and for the Council.\nElectronic tendering\nTendering is carried out through the Council's eProcurement portal for several reasons. An electronic process creates efficiencies for the Council and for bidders; it ensures that the tender process is fully auditable and the\nPublic Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCRs 2015)\n(and as amended) prescribe compulsory electronic tendering. Additionally, there are both cost and environmental benefits to electronic, rather than paper-based procurement.\nHelp with tendering\nThe Council cannot tender on your behalf, but it is always on hand to support bidders with the process within the constraints of equal treatment. Always read and follow the instructions for tendering and ask for feedback where you have not been successful. Wherever possible, the Council holds meet the buyer and training events to assist suppliers, or can point you in the direction of existing training and guidance provided by others.\nMeeting with the Council\nIn order to maintain equal treatment of all its suppliers, the Council does not meet with potential suppliers. However, the Procurement Team organises Meet the Buyer events on a regular basis and undertakes market engagement exercises for contracts that are complex or where requirements need the input of suppliers. These are notified to the market through advertisement on the Chest in the same way that tenders are advertised.\nSubmitting an interest in tendering\nWhen you have registered as a supplier on the Chest, you are able to formally register an interest in tendering for a specific opportunity when you see it advertised. Don't worry if you subsequently do not submit a tender, even if you have registered an interest, as this will not count against you when future opportunities are advertised. It may be, for instance, that you access the tender documentation after registering an interest and then decide that the opportunity does not match your business offer.\nChoosing a supplier\nFor individual one-off spends under £5,000: The Council is able to obtain the required goods or services by means of obtaining only one quotation. Such low value requirements are unlikely to be advertised on\nthe Chest\nand will not necessarily be notified to the Procurement Team.\nFor individual requirements between £5,000 and £24,999: the Council may use pre-existing framework agreements, search websites and catalogues, or undertake a Request for Quotation exercise which may or may not be advertised on\nthe Chest\nas an open opportunity.\nRequirements between £25,000 and the relevant\nWorld Trade Organisation Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) threshold\n: The Procurement Team leads the procurement activity. This means dependent upon risks identified and local market conditions, some competitions will be closed to identified local suppliers, whilst others will be openly advertised. Adverts are placed on\nthe Chest\nand\nContracts Finder\n.\nSuppliers interested in providing goods and services should make contact with individual Services within the Council.\nRequirements in excess of the GPA thresholds: The Procurement Team leads the activity, and advertises the opportunity on\nthe Chest\n,\nContracts Finder\n, and\nFind a Tender Service (FTS)\n.\nNote:\nAdverts published before the 31st December 2020 can be found in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union (OJEU)\nnot FTS.",

    "text": "Social Value is the positive impact that businesses and organisations can have on the local community. This can include supporting the environment, creating jobs, and improving the lives of residents.\nThe Council is committed to including Social Value in its contracts. This means that when we buy goods and services, we will consider how the provider can benefit the local community.\nSocial Value can be split into three areas\nSocial\nThis includes volunteering in the community, hosting community events in local businesses, and flexible working for staff.\nEconomic\nThis includes activities such a work placement, creating apprenticeships and jobs in the borough, employing local people, using local suppliers, and providing resources and advice for young people.\nEnvironmental\nThis means we will reduce our energy, water, and carbon usage. We will support improvements and maintaining of our public spaces and parks along with using sustainable products and materials.\nSocial Value can be either a mandatory part of the contract specification or an additional initiative proposed and implemented by the supplier. The Council appreciates both approaches.\nWhy considering social value is important\nSocial Value is not just a nice thing to do; it's a critical part of our corporate mission and a way to optimise our use of public funds. As financial constraints increase and demand for services expands, it's more important than ever to think creatively about how we spend our money.\nWe must constantly ask ourselves:\nWhat matters most to our local communities?\nHow can we deliver services in ways that positively impact the community and the environment?\nHow can we support local businesses?\nHow can we collaborate more effectively to engage hard-to-reach individuals?\nHow can we address current local challenges through community partnerships?\nThe Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012\nmandates that public bodies in England consider the inclusion of Social Value when procuring goods, services, and works subject to the Public Contracts Regulations 2015. This legislation doesn't alter the procurement process itself. Instead, it emphasises the public sector's responsibility to assess the broader impact (social, economic, and environmental) of its procurement decisions.\nWhat the Council is doing\nTake a look at what we are doing to\ndrive Social Value from Council contracts\n.\nTake a look further into our framework and guidance on social value:\nDocument\nSocial-Value-Procurement-Framework-2022-2026.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n65.51KB\n)\nDocument\nSocial-Value-Guidance.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n45.23KB\n)",

    "text": "Pre-Tender\nGet involved\nConsider influencing the buying organisation's Social Value policy and strategy by participating in policy discussions, strategic meetings, and market engagement activities.\nKnow the organisation\nFamiliarise yourself with the buying organisation's procurement strategy and any Social Value materials they have published. Understand their corporate priorities to align your approach.\nDuring the Tender\nRead thoroughly\nBefore crafting your bid, thoroughly review the buying organisation's procurement strategy and any other relevant information on their approach to Social Value.\nInvestigate priorities\nExplore the buying organisation's Corporate Priorities and the \"menu\" of ideas provided by the TOMs (Teams of Market Experts). Consider your past achievements in delivering Social Value commitments.\nCost-effectiveness\nUnderstand that solutions outside the core requirements should be delivered at no additional cost to the buying organisation. The costs of these additional elements should be borne by you.\nClarify doubts\nRead the tender documents carefully, including any guidance provided on responding to the Social Value element. If you have any questions, seek clarification during the designated clarification period. Raise Social Value concerns if not addressed adequately.\nPartnership with supply chain\nCollaborate with your supply chain or consortium members to identify and deliver Social Value commitments. Consider options that benefit both your business and the buying organisation, such as health and wellbeing support for staff.\nWriting the Bid\nAnswer accurately\nRespond directly to the specific questions posed, not questions you think should have been asked. Social Value may be both a core requirement and an opportunity to explore additional solutions. Clearly outline your approach to both.\nSpecificity is key\nAvoid generic responses. Tailor your answers to the buying organisation's specific needs and desires.\nDefinitive commitments\nAs a general rule, particularly when the tender falls under the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, ensure your response is definitive about the specific actions you will take.\nAvoid mere policies\nDon't just talk about existing policies or ongoing activities. Focus on concrete initiatives you will undertake if awarded the contract.\nStart, maintain, and expand\nOutline specific actions you will initiate upon contract award (new jobs, volunteering), maintain if retaining or winning the contract (retaining jobs, continued volunteering), and expand upon if securing the contract (volunteering in the buying organisation's area, setting up community groups).\nInnovation encouraged\nWhile staying relevant to the tender, embrace innovation and originality in your proposed Social Value commitments.\nPost-Tender\nContractual obligations\nIf successful, you will likely be contractually bound to fulfil your Social Value commitments. Ensure your proposals are realistic and achievable.\nReporting and progress\nAgree with the buying organisation on how and when you will report on your progress in delivering Social Value commitments throughout the contract.\nFeedback and improvement\nIf unsuccessful, seek feedback from the buying organisation, particularly regarding your Social Value approach. Use this feedback to strengthen your offer and approach for future opportunities.\nAdditional information for bidders\nSocial Value in quotations\nNot all tender opportunities include Social Value requirements. If Social Value is not mentioned in a tender document, you can inquire during the tender period to confirm whether it has been considered and disregarded.\nEqual treatment for suppliers\nThe Council ensures that all suppliers are treated equally by providing all bidders with the same comprehensive information to support their submissions.\nSocial Value for non-local suppliers\nBeing a non-local supplier does not preclude you from winning contracts. However, offering Social Value within the Council's locality can strengthen your bid.\nEvaluation criteria\nPrice is not the sole determinant in evaluating bids. Evaluation criteria are based on proportionality and relevance to the procurement in terms of Price, Quality, and Social Value.\nMarket engagement for bidders\nThe Council collaborates closely with service commissioners to identify and understand relevant and proportionate social, economic, and environmental opportunities for each contract. When appropriate, we engage with the market to provide feedback opportunities before issuing the tender.",

This may involve public consultation with users or residents to understand their priorities, or market engagement with suppliers to identify innovative ways to deliver Social Value.\nOur approach to social value\nOur approach to Social Value is to strike a balance between setting clear expectations and allowing for innovation and flexibility.

    "text": "Business rates, also known as non-domestic rates, are a way for businesses to contribute to the funding of local services. Although the council collects business rates, the amount payable is determined by the government.\nKnowsley Council is committed to safeguarding public funds and may use the information you provide or have access to for fraud prevention and detection purposes.\nAdditionally, the council may share this information with other organizations for these purposes, as well as for tax and charge administration and collection, and to fulfil other statutory enforcement responsibilities.\nFurther information about business rates can be found on the\nGovernment Information Website\n.\nCalculating business rates\nYour business rates bill is calculated by multiplying the rateable value of your property by the appropriate multiplier.\nThe rateable value is determined by the Valuation Office Agency, and the multiplier is set by the government.\nThe standard rating multiplier for 2023-24 is 51.2 pence, and the small business rates relief multiplier is 49.9 pence.\nTransitional arrangements may also be applied, and any applicable mandatory or discretionary reliefs are deducted.\nPayment options\nYou are not required to pay your entire business rates bill at once. You have the option to pay in ten- or twelve-monthly instalments starting in April. Failure to make timely payments will result in the cancellation of your instalment plan.\nPayment methods\nDirect Debit is the most convenient way to pay your business rates bill. We also offer a variety of alternative payment methods. For details on these options, please refer to our information on how to pay your business rates.\nAppeal your rateable value\nThe Valuation Office Agency (VOA) calculate rateable values. If you think the current value for your property is wrong you can:\nAppeal to the VOA and ask them to correct the details you think are wrong.\nContact\nWebsite\nhttp://www.voa.gov.uk/\nEmail\nratingnorthwest@voa.gsi.gov.uk\nTelephone\n03000 501 501\nAddress\nNon-Domestic Rates North West\nRedgrave Court\nMerton Road\nBootle\nMerseyside\nL20 7HS\nAppeal your rates\nif you and the VOA can’t agree through the Valuations Tribunal.\nAppeals\nYou are still obligated to pay your business rates while your appeal is pending. If you fail to do so, we will initiate recovery action, which may include the issuance of a summons and the imposition of additional costs.\nIf your appeal is successful, you will be refunded any overpaid business rates upon request. You will also be eligible for interest payments, provided you have made instalment payments in accordance with your bill, and we have not obtained a Liability Order.\nTransitional relief\nThe rateable value of non-domestic properties is typically reassessed every three years. If your property's rateable value increases significantly as a result of a revaluation, your rates will increase gradually. Transitional relief is a mechanism that limits the extent to which your rates can increase following a revaluation. We automatically calculate this relief and adjust your bill accordingly. The reduction for transitional relief will be displayed on your non-domestic rate bill if applicable.\nFuture revaluations\nThe most recent revaluation took effect on April 1, 2023, and the next revaluation is scheduled for 2026.\nEmpty property rates\nIf you own or rent a business property that is unoccupied, you are not required to pay business rates for the first three months. After this period, most businesses must pay full empty property rates. Industrial premises are exempt from business rates for the first six months after becoming empty.\nExemptions\nCertain properties are eligible for extended empty property relief:\nListed buildings that are unoccupied\nBuildings with a rateable value below £2,900 that are unoccupied\nProperties owned by charities if their next use will be for charitable purposes\nCommunity amateur sports club buildings if their next use will be as a sports club\nProperties where the owner is prohibited by law, by action taken by the Crown or a public authority, from occupying or allowing occupation\nPartial occupancy\nRatepayers are responsible for paying full business rates regardless of whether a property is fully or partially occupied. In certain circumstances, if a portion of a property is vacant for a brief period, we may be able to grant relief for the unoccupied portion.\nRelief for charities and similar organisations\nRelief may be granted to charities or similar organisations that occupy premises and use them wholly or primarily for charitable purposes. We may require additional information if you request this relief. This type of relief, known as mandatory relief, can reduce your business rates by up to 80%.\nDiscretionary rate relief\nIn certain circumstances, we may also grant relief towards all or part of the rates bill of organisations that occupy premises and are not established or conducted for profit. This is known as Discretionary Rate Relief, and each council has its own eligibility criteria. To apply for this relief, you must contact us and complete a form. We will also request information to confirm your eligibility.\nContact\nBusiness Rates Team\nTelephone\n0151 443 4126/4069\nEmail\nbusiness.rates@knowsley.gov.uk",

    "text": "About assets of community value\nThe Localism Act 2011 introduced a new concept called \"Assets of Community Value\" (ACVs). These are buildings or pieces of land that are important to a local community and are protected from being sold off without the community having a chance to bid for them.\nHow to identify an ACV\nAn asset of community value is a building or piece of land that:\nIs currently used, or has been used in the recent past, to benefit the local community in some way, such as by providing social, cultural, or recreational activities.\nCould continue to be used in this way in the future.\nWho can nominate an ACV\nGroups such as parish councils, local voluntary organisations, and community groups can nominate local land or buildings to be included in the list of ACVs maintained by local authorities.\nWhat happens when an ACV is sold\nThe owner of an ACV must notify the local authority when they intend to sell it. This triggers a moratorium period, which gives the local community time to prepare a bid for the property.\nIf no bidder comes forward during the moratorium period, the owner can sell the property to whomever they choose. However, if a community group expresses an interest in buying the property, the owner must give them a fair opportunity to bid.\nTypes of properties that are excluded from ACV status\nCertain types of properties are not eligible for ACV status, including:\nLand attached to residential property\nSites covered by the Caravan Sites Act\nLand used by public utilities\nHow long an ACV can stay on the list\nA property remains on the list of ACVs for five years. After this time, it can be removed from the list if the owner wishes to sell it.\nBenefits of ACVs\nAssets of community value can provide a number of benefits to local communities, including:\nProtecting important community assets from being lost to development\nProviding opportunities for local communities to take ownership of their own assets\nPromoting social cohesion and community spirit\nDownloads\nDocument\n1.

Do not proceed with the order until a valid purchase order number is provided.\nInvoice requirements\nTo ensure smooth invoice processing and timely payment, please adhere to the following invoice requirements:\nCompany details\nClearly include your company name and address on the invoice.\nVAT registration number (if applicable)\nIf registered for VAT, provide your VAT registration number on the invoice.\nInvoice number and date\nAssign a unique invoice number and include the invoice date.\nValid purchase order number\nProminently display the valid purchase order number provided by the council.\nService area or Council contact\nIdentify the service area requesting the goods or services or provide the name of the council contact person.\nDetailed description of goods or services\nProvide a clear and detailed description of the goods or services supplied.\nLine item breakdown\nFor each line item, include the quantity, description, unit price, net value, VAT rate, VAT value, and line total.\nInvoice totals\nCalculate and display the invoice totals for Net, VAT, and Gross amounts.\nElectronic invoice submission\nTo ensure timely invoice processing and payment, send all invoices electronically to the email address specified on your purchase order.

The form and accompanying leaflet advises you how to make changes if needed.\nWhere property details have not matched, residents must respond to the annual canvass form to confirm if the pre-printed information is correct or if changes are needed.\nIf changes need to be made, you can make them by completing and returning the form in the prepaid envelope, or you can use the online link on the form to make changes (you will need the security codes at the bottom of the form to do this). You can also make changes by email or telephone – details are on your form.\nIf names are to be added (including 16 and 17-year-olds), the new people must\nregister online.\nPlease review and complete the form as soon as possible if changes need to be made.\nFor further information, please call 0151 443 2222, or you can\nsend an email.",

    "text": "Shared Ownership\nShared ownership offers a flexible option to purchase a home, allowing you to own a portion of the property while renting the remaining share. You can typically purchase between 25% and 75% of the property's value. To finance your share, you'll obtain a mortgage and use your savings, while rent will be paid on the unowned portion. As you increase your ownership share (known as staircasing), your rent decreases.\nFor more detailed information on shared ownership, please visit the\ngovernment website.\nShared Ownership for Older Adults\nShared ownership may be available to individuals aged 55 and above who wish to downsize or seek specialised support as they age. Like standard shared ownership, you can typically buy a share between 25% and 75% of the property value, with rent paid on the remaining share. If you purchase a 75% share, you may not need to pay rent on the remaining portion. The maximum share you can typically purchase is 75% to ensure these properties remain accessible to older adults in the future.\nFor more information on Older Persons Shared Ownership, please visit\nOwn You Home's website.\nRent to Buy\nRent to Buy is a government initiative that allows you to rent a newly constructed home for a specified period, typically five years, with the option to purchase the property outright at the end of the term. Alternatively, you can pursue shared ownership before the five-year period ends, provided you meet the eligibility criteria. If you choose not to purchase the property, you may be able to continue renting it after the five years.\nYour landlord will discuss the available options with you. Under Rent to Buy, properties are rented at a discounted rate to help you save for a deposit.\nBoth shared ownership and rent-to-buy provide affordable paths to homeownership in Knowsley. Explore these options and find a solution that aligns with your financial circumstances and housing needs.\nFor more information on Older Persons Shared Ownership, please visit\nOwn You Home's website.\nCurrent affordable home ownership developments\nCurrent developments where there are affordable homeownership opportunities available in the borough are:\nThe Watch Factory, Prescot (Livv Homes)\nCanterbury Park, Huyton (Livv Homes)\nThe Finches, Halewood (Livv Homes)\nThe Woodlands, Halsnead Garden Village (Your Housing)\nWoodcroft Corner, Halsnead Garden Village (Onward Homes)\nThe Meadows, Halsnead Garden Village (Cobalt Homes)\nThere are several registered providers, commonly known as housing associations, who provide shared ownership and rent to buy homes in Knowsley.  Please visit the links below to check availability:\nTorus Homes\nOnward Living (Onward Homes)\nLivv Housing\nOne Vision Housing (Sovini)\nHome Reach (Heylo Housing)\nForLiving\nCobalt Homes\nProperties are sometimes advertised on websites such as Rightmove and Zoopla.",

Phase 4 of the Energy Companies Obligation is optional therefore local authorities and energy suppliers are not obliged to take part.\nResidents of Knowsley may receive letters or flyers from companies or lead generators offering measures under the Energy Companies Obligation.\nWhat the measures may include\nReplacement boilers and heating systems\nInsulation (wall, loft and underfloor)\nRenewable energy technologies (solar panels)\nEligibility and process\nThe companies or lead generators will check a resident’s criteria to see if they meet national or local eligibility criteria. Those who qualify through Knowsley Council’s local eligibility criteria will be asked by the company or lead generator to provide evidence of their eligibility and to sign a privacy agreement to share their data.\nThe company or lead generator then submits an application form to the local authority and if the eligibility criteria is met and the correct evidence is provided, a “Local Authority Declaration” will be provided to them.\nThe declaration does not entitle you to any grant, grants are provided at the discretion of the installation companies and are subject to a home energy survey.\nInstallation guidelines\nKnowsley Council does not oversee the Energy Companies Obligation or recommend any installation companies. The Energy Companies Obligation is administered by OFGEM and all installers working on the scheme must be registered with Trust Mark.\nResidents must ensure that the installation company proposing to carry out works under ECO is a Trust Mark Registered Business for the works being carried out.\nVisit Trust Mark to check\nGreat British Insulation Scheme\nAbout the scheme\nThe Great British Insulation Scheme is a Government scheme launched in August 2023 to help households to insulate their homes to make them more energy efficient and save on energy bills.\nThe scheme will run until March 2026.\nYou could qualify for free insulation to your home through the scheme if you are on a low income, qualifying benefits or are in a council tax band A-D and your home has and Energy Performance Certificate rating of D and below (E or below if you are renting).\nFor more information on the Great British Insulation Scheme and to use the\nGovernment’s online eligibility checker\nto see if you qualify.\nAlternatively, call the helpline on 0800 098 7950 or contact your energy supplier directly for advice.\nDocument\nStatement of Intent .pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n227KB\n)",

    "text": "1. Lower your heating thermostat\nReduce your room temperature by turning down your heating thermostat to 18°C. This simple step could save you up to 10% on your heating bills. If you have a programmer, set your heating and hot water to activate only when needed, rather than running continuously.\n2. Optimise water temperature\nNext time your boiler receives servicing, ask the Gas Safe engineer to adjust your water temperature to a comfortable level. This will ensure you're using hot water efficiently.\n3. Prevent heat loss\nAs dusk approaches, draw your curtains to prevent heat from escaping through windows. Additionally, check for drafts around windows and doors and seal any gaps to minimize heat loss.\n4. Switch off lights when leaving rooms\nMake a habit of turning off lights whenever you leave a room to conserve energy.\n5. Avoid standby mode\nUnplug appliances when not in use to eliminate standby power consumption. Additionally, avoid leaving laptops and mobile phones on charge unnecessarily.\n6. Optimise appliance usage\nFill up your washing machine, tumble dryer, or dishwasher whenever possible. Running one full load is more energy-efficient than two half loads. Choose the economy setting whenever available.\n7. Boil water efficiently\nOnly boil as much water as you need. When using an electric kettle, cover the elements to retain heat and reduce energy consumption.\n8. Fix dripping taps\nA dripping hot water tap not only wastes water but also consumes unnecessary energy. Repair leaking taps promptly and ensure they are fully turned off when not in use.\n9. Switch to LED bulbs\nReplace traditional incandescent bulbs with energy-efficient LED bulbs. LED bulbs last up to 10 times longer and consume significantly less energy.\n10. Explore government energy grants\nCheck if you qualify for government energy grants under the Energy Companies Obligation (ECO) scheme. These grants can provide financial assistance for home insulation or heating upgrades, improving your home's energy efficiency and reducing your fuel bills.\n11. Defrost your freezer regularly\nDefrosting your freezer regularly can significantly improve its energy efficiency. When ice buildup exceeds a quarter of an inch, it can affect the door seal's effectiveness, allowing cold air to escape and increasing energy consumption.",

They can also attract crime and anti-social behaviour, and can even be a safety hazard. In addition, empty homes can devalue surrounding properties and can stop people who are homeless or vulnerable from getting a home.\nWhat can be done about empty homes\nIf you are an empty home owner, there are a number of things you can do to bring your property back into use. You could:\nOccupy the property yourself or move in a relative or friend.\nRent or lease your property.\nSell your property on to an owner-occupier, developer, or housing association.\nHelp available to empty home owners\nIf you own an empty property that you are struggling to bring back into use, there is help available. The council can provide you with:\nGuidance on how to sell your property.\nGuidance on how to rent out your property.\nFinancial assistance.\nHelp to maximise property opportunities, such as conversions.\nAdvice on how to find a suitable builder.\nThe benefits of bringing empty homes back into use\nThere are many benefits to bringing empty homes back into use. These include:\nAdded security against anti-social behaviour, crime, and squatting.\nThe ability to charge rent if you become a landlord.\nLong-term investment potential.\nThe property is no longer a local eyesore.\nImproved local area, making it more attractive to investors.\nA safer area to live in.\nWhen the council take enforcement action\nThe council will try as much as possible to work with owners to bring empty properties back into use. However, if an owner is unwilling to cooperate and their empty home is causing problems in the neighbourhood, the council may have to consider legal action.\nOptions available to the council include:\nStatutory enforcement action\nThe council can use a wide range of enforcement powers to make sure an owner improves their property.\nEmpty Dwelling Management Order (EDMO)\nThis enables the council or a nominated party (usually a registered provider) to take over management of the property for up to seven years.\nEnforced sale\nThis allows the council to force the sale of an empty property to recover debts owed to the council.\nCompulsory Purchase Order (CPO)\nThis allows the council to buy a property from an owner even if they don't give their consent.\nMatching empty homes\nThe council also runs a\nMatchmaker Scheme\nthat matches empty properties with potential buyers. This can be a great way to sell your empty property quickly and easily.\nFor further information, you can read our Empty Homes Strategy below.\nDocument\nEmpty-Homes-Strategy-2016-2021_1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n2.51MB\n)\nCouncil Tax on an empty home\nEmpty properties may be entitled to a\nCouncil Tax discount\nunder certain circumstances.\nEmpty homes in your area\nIf you are concerned about an empty property in your neighbourhood, you can\nreport it here\n.\nContact\nTelephone\n0151 443 4712\nEmail\nempty.homes@knowsley.gov.uk",

    "text": "The LGA Peer Challenge process includes a review of the following:\nLocal priorities and outcomes – considering the clarity of the Council’s priorities and their relationship to the local context.\nOrganisational and place leadership – considering the effectiveness of the Council’s local leadership, including the relationships with partner agencies and communities.\nGovernance and culture – considering the clarity and robustness of the Council’s governance arrangements, including a culture of respect, challenge, and scrutiny.\nFinancial planning and management – considering the Council’s current financial position and the Council’s strategy and plans to address financial challenges.\nCapacity for improvement – considering whether the organisation can support the delivery of local priorities and has the capacity to improve as appropriate.\nThe\nfeedback report from the re-visit undertaken in December 2021 can be viewed here\n. In summary, the review team acknowledged that:\nThe Council has a good understanding of its communities.\nThe value of the Knowsley Better Together approach (bringing people and organisations together for the benefit of Knowsley and its communities) and commended the Council for their induction process by introducing the “Knowsley Better Together Journey”.\nThe Council has taken brave decisions regarding investments to stimulate the economy.\nThe Council has made progress in developing the Council’s leadership and culture (which was well illustrated through the Council’s effective response to COVID-19) and the joint work which took place with partner agencies and voluntary and community organisations.\nThe Council continues to have strong financial management in place.\nAs expected, the Peer Challenge team made several recommendations for the Council to consider, which focus on taking Knowsley Better Together “to the next level” by embedding the principles into the Knowsley Council Plan 2022-2025 and further developing community engagement and empowerment.\nAn action plan has been developed to progress these recommendations. You can view the action plan\nhere\n.\nThe team conducted a further re-visit to monitor progress against the Council’s action plan. You can\nread the progress review report here\n, but in summary, the team noted:\nThe pandemic has resulted in staff and communities feeling more empowered, which should continue progressing\nKnowsley Better Together (bringing people and organisations together for the benefit of Knowsley and its residents) has been instrumental in the management of COVID-19.\nExtensive consultation has been undertaken over the Summer to find out from communities what they need to thrive and not just survive. The results have shaped the Knowsley Offer, launched in February 2023 and outlines the help and support available to residents, addressing their key priorities.\nThe Council has developed a Stronger Communities Strategy, which focuses on growing community capacity and supporting more people to be active within their communities so that people can help themselves, each other and their neighbourhoods.\nA Leadership Programme is being developed for the six local authorities across the Liverpool City Region (Halton, Knowsley, Liverpool, St Helens, Sefton and Wirral Councils), strengthening partnership arrangements and providing greater opportunities for people working in the Liverpool City Region.\nThe Council Plan for 2022-2025 has been approved, which focuses on effective support for those in need, inclusive skills and growth and climate emergency and achieving net zero.\nThe Council has been raising the profile of the Borough by attracting media attention for projects such as the opening of the Shakespeare North Playhouse, along with media coverage generated related to the Council’s Levelling Up Fund bids.\nFor further information on the Corporate Peer Challenge, contact Melanie Duncan via email at\nmelanie.duncan@knowsley.gov.uk\nor by telephone at 0151 443 5824.",

    "text": "Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA)\nThe National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) is a set of rules that the government uses to make decisions about planning and development. The NPPF says that local authorities should have a clear understanding of the land available for housing in their area. To do this, they should carry out a Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA)\nA SHLAA is a report that identifies and assesses land that could be used for housing development. It considers factors such as how much land is available, whether it is suitable for housing, and whether it would be economically viable to develop.\nThe purpose of a SHLAA is to make sure that there is enough land available to meet the housing needs of an area. It can also be used to decide where to build new homes in local plans.\nThe first SHLAA, published in March 2010, was carried out jointly with Knowsley, Sefton and West Lancashire Council. Updates for Knowsley were conducted in 2011, 2012, 2016, 2022, 2023, and 2024.\nDocuments\nSHLAA 2024\nDocument\nKnowsley Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment – 2024 Update.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n17.93MB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix E Housing Commitments Forecast.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n258.22KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix F Local Plan Housing Allocations Forecast.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n189.71KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix G SHLAA Sites Forecast.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n372.84KB\n)\nSHLAA 2023\nDocument\nKnowsley-Strategic-Housing-Land-Availability-Assessment-–-2023-Update (1).docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n14.44MB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix-F-Housing-Commitments-Forecast_1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n11.34KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix-G-Local-Plan-Housing-Allocations-Forecast_1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n5.68KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix-H-SHLAA-Sites-Forecast_1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n83.13KB\n)\nSHLAA 2022\nDocument\nSHLAA-2022-Update.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n5.68MB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix-F-Housing-Commitments-Forecast.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n310.71KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix-G-Local-Plan-Housing-Allocations-Forecast.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n79.4KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix-H-SHLAA-Sites-Forecast.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n82.89KB\n)\nOlder\nDocument\nKnowsley-SHLAA-Report-2016-Update-Final-Report-Draft-wo-app.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n210.32KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendix-One-to-Three.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n3.8MB\n)\nDocument\nDatasheet_Excluded-2_Part1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n2.99MB\n)\nDocument\nDatasheet_Excluded-2_Part2.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n3MB\n)\nDocument\nDatasheet_Excluded-2_Part3_1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n743.82KB\n)\nDocument\nEB01_StrategicHousingLandAvailabilityAssessment-2012.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n16.38MB\n)\nDocument\nEB02_StrategicHousingLandAvailabilityAssessment-2011Update.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n8.79MB\n)\nDocument\nEB03_StrategicHousingLandAvailabilityAssessment-2010.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n6.24MB\n)\nCall for Sites Exercise\nKnowsley Council invites anyone interested in proposing land for new housing development to submit their suggestions. The cut-off date for submission is 1 June annually to be considered in the SHLAA for the corresponding year.\nThe main purpose of the SHLAA is to identify land that could be used for housing and to assess how likely it is to be developed. This helps the council to understand whether there is enough land available to meet the housing needs of the local area.\nThe SHLAA is not a statement of council policy, it does not allocate land for housing, and it does not signal the start of a new Local Plan. The base date for each SHLAA will be April 1 of the year in which the SHLAA is carried out.\nAnyone interested in proposing land for housing development can do so by completing a Call for Sites Form and submitting it to the council. The form should also include a plan of the land that is being proposed. The council will consider all proposals that are submitted, but they will be assessed against planning policy and other relevant planning considerations. Submitting a proposal does not guarantee that the council will include the land in the SHLAA or that the land will be used for housing development.\nDownload form\nDocument\nKnowsley Call For Sites Form 2024.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n37.94KB\n)\nReturn to\nEmail\nlocalplan@knowsley.gov.uk\nPost\nPlanning Policy Team\nKnowsley Council\nHuyton Library\nCivic Way\nHuyton\nKnowsley\nL36 6GD",

During the tenancy certain issues may arise that affect landlords and tenants, such as changes to rent or terms and conditions, changes to the type of tenancy or ending a tenancy.\nFor issues that fall inside regulation the government has a series of prescribed forms which should be filled in depending on your scenario. They are called\nassured tenancy forms\n,\nforms for landlords and/or tenants to propose action relating to tenancy agreements.\nImportant information\nFrom 1 October 2015 the validity of section 21 notices depend on when the tenancy started. Landlords who have granted a tenancy after this date will no longer be able to serve a section 21 unless:\nYou have provided a copy of the Gas Safety Certificate, Energy Performance Certificate and a copy of the latest How to Rent guide\nYou have protected the deposit in an appropriate scheme and issued information required to the tenant within 30 days\nYou have used the prescribed Section 21 Form\nFurthermore, landlords cannot serve notice during the first 4 months of the AST start date and once served the section 21 will expire 6 months from the date of service.\nAlso, the landlord will not be able to serve a Section 21 for a period of 6 months following the council’s involvement due to disrepair issues which leads to enforcement action through either an improvement notice or emergency remedial action.\nFrom 1 October 2018 AST’s regardless of when they started will be subject to the above changes.\nHow to Rent Guide\nThe guide is for tenants and landlords in the private rented sector to help them understand their rights and responsibilities and contains a useful checklist when renting properties.\nFrom 1 October 2015 landlords have been required to issue the latest edition of the How to Rent guide on all new and renewal tenancies. The guide will be updated from time to time and landlords must ensure the tenant has the most current issue.\nDownload the latest edition of the How to Rent guide\n.\nHow to Let Guide\nThe government has produced a guide for current private residential landlords and anyone interested in letting a property in the private rented sector - explaining responsibilities, legal requirements and best practice.\nIt does not cover leasehold, holiday lets or \"resident landlords\" who let to lodgers.\nDownload the latest edition of the How to Let guide\n.\nTenancy Deposit Schemes\nFor tenancies starter after the 6 April 2007 landlords have been required to store tenancy deposits in 1 of 3 government backed schemes:\nDeposit Protection Service (Custodial and Insured)\nMy Deposits\n- including deposits that were held by Capita\nTenancy Deposit Scheme\nThe schemes protect the deposit and return the deposit once both parties have agreed how much should be returned. Landlords are required to store the deposit and issue the tenant with certain information about the scheme.\nTake a look at the government's guidance on\ntenancy deposit protection\nfor information about how to store deposits, information landlords must provide and the penalties landlords may face for failing to abide by the rules.\nTenant Fees Act 2019\nAs of June 2019, it is illegal to charge tenant fees other than a deposit, a holding deposit and rent in advance. The changes also include a limit to deposits, you may only charge 5 weeks' worth of rent as a deposit, and you cannot reduce rent over an assured short hold tenancy; this means that you cannot charge £1000 for the first month and £800 for the consecutive months.\nFor other changes to the law, please the government's\nTenant Fee Act 2019 - Guidance\n.",

Having due regard for advancing equality involves:\nRemoving or minimising disadvantages suffered by people due to their protected characteristics.\nTaking steps to meet the needs of people from protected groups where these are different from the needs of other people.\nEncouraging people from protected groups to participate in public life or in other activities where their participation is disproportionately low.\nOur Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Objectives for 2021-2025 are:\nAchieve Disability Confident Level 2\nReduce our Gender Pay Gap\nAchieve the Navajo Charter Mark\nFulfil our Race Equality Declaration of Intent\nEquality & Diversity Four-Year Progress Report 2012 - 2016\nEquality & Diversity Four-Year Report\nEquality & Diversity Policy Statement 2022 - 2025\nEquality & Diversity Policy Statement 2022 - 2025\nRace Equality - Declaration of Intent\nRace Equality - Declaration of Intent\nEquality Communications Guidance\nEquality Communications Guidance\nWorkforce profile\nThe Workforce Profile helps the Council meet the requirements of The Equality Act 2010, General Equality Duty to:\nEliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation;\nAdvance equality of opportunity and\nFoster good relations\nThe Workforce Profile is a valuable resource to help monitor the workforce and provide year-on-year benchmarking information to assist workforce planning.

    "text": "Listed buildings are special buildings that have been identified as being of national importance due to their architectural or historic interest. Knowsley has over 100 listed buildings, including one Grade I building, four Grade II* buildings, and the remainder listed at Grade II.\nGrades of listed buildings\nGrade I\nBuildings of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important.\nGrade II:*\nParticularly important buildings of more than special interest.\nGrade II\nNationally important and of special interest.\nConsent for work on listed buildings\nYou must get consent from the council before carrying out any work that affects the special interest of a listed building. This includes restorations, alterations, demolitions, and extensions. The requirement for consent also applies to internal works and works affecting outbuildings and other structures associated with the principal listed building.\nPenalties for unauthorised work\nUndertaking work to a listed building that affects its special interest without first gaining Listed Building Consent is a criminal offence. If you are in any doubt whether you require consent for works, you should contact Planning Services at 0151 443 2380 for advice.\nMaintenance of listed buildings\nIf you own a listed building, you are responsible for its maintenance. Failure to maintain a listed building in an acceptable condition may result in the council using its enforcement powers to ensure the building is preserved.\nFinding out about listed buildings in Knowsley\nThere are two main ways to find out if a building is listed in Knowsley:\nOnline Search\nYou can use the Knowsley Council website or search online on the\nNational Heritage List for England (NHLE)\nto view a comprehensive list of listed buildings in Knowsley, including their addresses and grading.\nView the listed buildings in Knowsley\nDirect Inquiry\nIf you have any doubts about a particular building, contact the Planning Service for accurate information. They can confirm whether it's listed and the extent of permitted modifications without requiring listed building consent.\nProtection offered by listing\nListing grants a building legal protection from demolition or alterations that could compromise its significance as a structure of architectural or historical importance. This protection covers both the exterior and interior of the building, as well as any fixtures or structures attached to it or within its curtilage.\nListed building consent requirements\nListed Building Consent (LBC) is mandated for any works, including demolition, alteration, or extension to a listed building, that might jeopardise its architectural or historical significance. This includes changes to the building's interior and works that affect the building's surroundings.\nApplying for listing\nAny individual can propose that a building be listed, and applications should be submitted to Historic England. They will then evaluate the request and recommend to the Secretary of State whether the building should be listed. For more information on the application procedure and eligibility criteria, please refer to\nHistoric England's website.\nApplication\nIf you're unsure whether your proposed changes to a listed building will be approved, you can seek informal advice by submitting a\nPre-application request\nfor advice. A fee is applicable for this service.\nApplications for Listed Building Consent must include a\nHeritage Statement\nand a\nDesign and Access Statement\n, which can be combined into a single document.\nApplications for Planning Permission, where the work may affect the setting of a listed building, must also include a\nHeritage Statement\n. A\nDesign and Access Statement\nmay also be required in some cases, and it can be combined with the Heritage Statement.\nTo access application forms, guidance notes on completing each form, and checklists for the required information, please visit the Planning Portal website using the links below.\nListed Building Consent for works or extension to a Listed Building\nDocument\nHelp011_england_en.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n78.14KB\n)\nDocument\nV4305Form011_england_en.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n534.87KB\n)\nPlanning permission and Listed Building Consent for the alteration of or extension of a dwelling\nDocument\nV4305Form003_england_en.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n547.82KB\n)\nDocument\nHelp003_england_en.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n217.5KB\n)\nPlanning permission with Listed Building Consent application\nDocument\nV4305Form008_england_en.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.62MB\n)\nDocument\nHelp008_england_en.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n282.09KB\n)\nPlease complete the appropriate form and return to\nEmail\nplanning@knowsley.gov.uk\nPost\nKnowsley Metropolitan Borough Council\nPO Box 26\nArchway Road\nHuyton\nL36 9FB\nDrop off\nUse our drop-off letterbox on the right side of Huyton Municipal Building main entrance.\nPlease make sure information is enveloped and clearly labelled for the attention of ‘Planning Services’\nBefore submitting your application, please make sure you have included the relevant documents and enclosed the appropriate\napplication fee\n.",

Please visit our\nConservation Areas page\nfor more information on these areas, to view their Appraisals and Management Plans and also find guidance on applying for Planning Permission for work which affects land and property in, or affecting the setting of, a Conservation Area.\nListed Buildings\nThere are currently over 100 Listed Buildings within the borough of Knowsley. Please visit our\nListed Buildings page\nfor more information on these properties including their addresses and grading, and guidance on applying for Listed Building Consent and/or Planning Permission for work that affects a listed building or its setting.\nHistoric Parks and Gardens\nThe Register of Historic Parks and Gardens is maintained by\nHistoric England\nand includes a range of parks, gardens and cemeteries which are chosen for their special historic interest.\nWithin Knowsley there are two historic parks:\nKnowsley Park\nis registered at Grade II.  It has its origins in the 13th Century and has since been altered and enlarged several times.\nCroxteth Hall Park\nis also registered at Grade II, it is mostly sited within Liverpool City Council’s area, however a small portion of the 19th century landscaped park extends into Knowsley.\nIf you wish to find out more about how sites are chosen or suggest a site for designation as a historic park and garden, advice is available on\nHistoric England’s\nwebsite.\nPlanning applications for works which affect Historic Parks or Gardens or their settings are required to be supported by a\nheritage statement\n.\nArchaeology\nKnowsley has no designated Scheduled Monuments, but its past has left a rich legacy of archaeological remains which require consideration when development proposals are brought forward through the planning process. The council takes advice on archaeology from\nMerseyside Environmental Advisory Service\n, which maintains the\nMerseyside Historic Environment Record (HER)\nas a source of information about the archaeology and historic buildings of Knowsley.\nIf your development may affect archaeology, you will be expected to undertake a suitable level of assessment as part of the planning process.\nNon-designated heritage assets\nAlongside ‘designated’ heritage assets (such as listed buildings, conservation areas etc.), there are many sites that do not quite meet the criteria for formal designation, but which are of local historic interest. These historic features and places add to the quality and interest of the local scene and are often valued by local people. The effect of development on non-designated heritage assets is a material consideration in determining relevant planning applications.\nThe type of features which can be considered non-designated heritage assets is wide ranging, including buildings, structures, monuments, archaeological sites and landscapes.\nPlanning applications which affect non-designated heritage assets, whether it is included in a ‘local list’ should be accompanied by a\nHeritage Statement\n.\nKnowsley Council has begun to develop a Local List of buildings and structures of historic or architectural interest to help identify locally important non-designated heritage assets.  The Merseyside Local List project was developed with government funding as part of a shared scheme with Wirral and Sefton Councils.\nDevelopment of Knowsley’s individual local list is currently paused. Nominations made as part of the initial project remain under consideration.\nGrant Aid\nPlease visit our Grant Aid page\nhere\nto access information about the Prescot High Street Heritage Action Zone (HSHAZ), the Prescot Townscape Heritage Initiative (THI) grant scheme and find links to other potential sources of heritage grant funding.\nPre-application Advice\nIf you are considering applying for permission for works to a designated or undesignated heritage asset you can seek our advice on your proposals before submitting an application.  Please see our pre-application advice page\nhere\nfor details.",

Three additional UDP policies were replaced upon the adoption of the Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste Local Plan. Subsequently, 36 policies were deleted with the adoption of the Local Plan Core Strategy.\nAs a result, 39 UDP Policies remain in effect. Appendix C of the Local Plan Core Strategy provides a comprehensive list of the UDP Policies that continue to be saved.\nLocal Plan Policies Map\nThe Local Plan Policies Map incorporates amendments made following the adoption of the Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste Local Plan in July 2013 and the Knowsley Local Plan Core Strategy in 2016.\nThe Policies Map is available as an interactive tool available\nhere\n.\nMerseyside and Halton Joint Waste Local Plan\nThe Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste Local Plan was adopted in July 2013 by the six constituent authorities of Halton, Knowsley, Liverpool, Sefton, St. Helens, and Wirral.

SPDs are non-statutory documents that can elaborate on specific sites, particular issues, or general planning principles. They serve as valuable tools for ensuring that development aligns with the overall vision and objectives outlined in the Local Plan.\nLocal Development Order\nThe Knowsley Industrial and Business Parks Local Development Order (LDO) was a planning instrument that aimed to simplify the planning permission process for development within the Knowsley Industrial and Business Parks. The LDO was designed to support the regeneration of the Parks and maximize their contribution to the local and sub-regional economy.\nThe LDO expired on January 28, 2018, and its policies are no longer in force. However, the LDO played a significant role in facilitating development and investment within the Knowsley Industrial and Business Parks during its lifespan.\nKnowsley Industrial and Business Parks: Local Development Order and Statement of Reasons and Order Design Code\nDocument\nPP29-Draft-Local-Development-Order-KIP-and-KBP-v2.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n2.72MB\n)\nDocument\nLocal-Development-Order-Design-Code-v2.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.59MB\n)\nStatement of Community Involvement\nThe Statement of Community Involvement is the document that explains how Knowsley Council will involve the community in planning issues.

The LDS serves several crucial purposes:\nInforms the public\nIt provides a starting point for the residents of Knowsley to learn about the borough's planning policies and how they can participate in the process.\nDefines the scope\nIt outlines which planning policy documents we will create as part of the Local Plan, specifying when they will be produced.\nEstablishes a timeline\nIt sets a timetable for reviewing the planning policy documents once they have been finalised.\nThe LDS is an essential tool for ensuring that the Local Plan is developed in a transparent, efficient, and inclusive manner. By providing clear timelines and engaging with the public, the LDS helps to ensure that the Local Plan meets the needs of the Knowsley community.\nDocument\nKnowsley_LDS_Final_March 2025.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n57.09KB\n)\nLiverpool City Region Spatial Planning Statement of Common Ground\nThe Liverpool City Region Spatial Planning Statement of Common Ground has been agreed between the local authorities of Halton, Knowsley, Liverpool, St. Helens, Sefton, West Lancashire and Wirral, along with the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.\nThe Statement has been prepared jointly in response to the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019) requirement for strategic policy-making authorities to document agreement and cooperation on cross boundary strategic planning matters1.

In parished areas of Knowsley, only the local Parish or Town Council can lead on Neighbourhood Planning for your community. In non-parished areas of the Borough, a community gathering known as a Neighbourhood Forum needs to be established to lead the process.\nIn either case, the qualifying community body (Parish/Town Council or prospective Neighbourhood Forum) needs to apply to Knowsley Council to have an area designated as a Neighbourhood Area.  This will then become the area where Neighbourhood Plans apply.",

The main objective of the SPD is to ensure a good choice of travel modes to all new developments in Knowsley.  It can be used by developers to ensure that their proposals are accessible, promote sustainable travel patterns and minimise the congestion and pollution caused by vehicles. It will be used to assess planning applications in relation to transport requirements.\nThe SPD does not contain dimensions for car-parking spaces and manoeuvring areas.  These can be found in the Department for Transport document “Manual for Streets”.\nAlthough the SPD covers the Knowsley Borough, it was developed in close partnership with the other districts on Merseyside and with Merseytravel. This was to ensure a relatively consistent approach across Merseyside to securing access to new development by a choice of transport modes, i.e. walking, cycling, public transport as well as by private motor vehicles.\nDocument\nTransport_spd_consultationstatement.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n624.86KB\n)\nDocument\nB - Accessibility Assessment Form.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n98.44KB\n)\nDocument\nAppendixCAccessibilityMaps 1 of 3.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n3.15MB\n)\nDocument\nAppendixCAccessibilityMaps 2 of 3.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n2.42MB\n)\nDocument\nAppendixCAccessibilityMaps 3 of 3.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n2.29MB\n)\nDocument\nTransport SPD Adoption Statement 1 Sept 2010.doc.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n87.17KB\n)\nDocument\nTravelSPDLowRes.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.97MB\n)\nDocument\nSustainability Appraisal  Strategic Environmental Assessment-1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.79MB\n)\nDocument\nSustainability Appraisal  Strategic Environmental Assessment Non Technical Summary.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n79.69KB\n)\nDocument\nHabitats Regulations Assessment.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n3.23MB\n)\nDesign Quality in New Development Supplementary Planning Document\nThe Design Quality in New Development Supplementary Planning Document identifies the overarching context for design in the Borough, and highlights Borough-wide issues which should be taken into account in designing new development.  This includes guidance relating to placing buildings, density and form, accessibility, landscaping, public open space, sustainable design, minimising crime, and preserving the built heritage.\nDocument\n27-Design-Quality-in-New-Development-SPD.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n5.24MB\n)\nShopfronts and Signage Design Supplementary Planning Document\nThe Shopfronts and Signage Design Supplementary Planning Document provides detailed guidance to developers on specific issues relating to design of new and altered shop fronts and signage.  This includes best practice on shop front composition, proportion, styles, materials, colours and security, together with requirements of signage in terms of types, position and illumination.\nDocument\nKnowsley-Shopfront-and-Signage-Design-SPD-Consultation-Statement-14-06-2023-2023.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n161.97KB\n)\nDocument\nKnowsley-Shopfront-and-Signage-Design-SPD-Adoption-Statement-14-06-2023.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n139.94KB\n)\nDocument\nShopfront-and-Signage-Design-SPD-Adoption-Version-08-06-2023.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n2.26MB\n)\nDeveloper Contributions SPD\nThis SPD supplements the Core Strategy policies by providing detailed guidance on how developer contributions will operate in Knowsley.

    "text": "Keeping our highways safe\nKnowsley Council is responsible for maintaining all adopted roads and pavements across Knowsley, ensuring a safe and accessible transportation network for residents and visitors alike. The council's comprehensive highways maintenance program encompasses a wide range of tasks, from drainage and gully cleaning to pothole repairs and road marking.\nDrainage and gully cleaning\nA well maintained drainage system is crucial for preventing flooding on the road, Knowsley Council regularly inspects and cleans gullies grids, as well as drains to ensure they are free of debris and functioning effectively.\nPothole repairs\nKnowsley Council considers that a pothole is a defect in the road surface at least 40mm in depth or at least 25mm in the footway, anything less will not be repaired.  Knowsley Council regularly inspect the footways and roads to identify where potholes need to be repaired.\nRoad markings\nClear and visible road markings are essential for traffic safety, Knowsley Council regularly repaints road markings to ensure they can be easily seen.\nVehicle restrain barriers and pedestrian guardrails\nVehicle restraint barriers and pedestrian guardrails are used to separate pedestrians and vehicles from hazards, these are regularly inspected by Knowsley Council and repaired when necessary.\nScheduled repair works\nKnowsley Council undertakes scheduled road repairs to address larger issues and maintain the overall condition of the road network. These repairs may involve resurfacing, pavement patching, or structural improvements.\nNHT survey results\nThe National Highways and Transport (NHT) Public Satisfaction Survey is a postal survey which is run annually. The survey, which covers the vast majority of Highways and Transport services, asks respondents to rate their satisfaction levels with different areas of service. It uses standard questions to allow for benchmarking comparisons between all participating authorities.\nThe NHT survey includes questions on perceptions and satisfaction with highways and transport services,  and also collects some data on the use of different transport modes and access to services.\nDocument\nNHT Survey 2024.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n975.13KB\n)\nDocument\n2023 Authority Annual Report.PDF\n(\nPDF\n,\n969.29KB\n)\nDocument\nNHT survey report 2022.PDF\n(\nPDF\n,\n932.25KB\n)\nDocument\n2021-NHT-Survey-Executive-Summary.PDF\n(\nPDF\n,\n342.65KB\n)\nDocument\nNHT-survey-report-2020.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n751.37KB\n)\nDocument\nNHT-Survey-2019.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n319.65KB\n)\nDocument\nNHT-Survey-2018.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n994.82KB\n)\nHighway Maintenance Programme\nOur highway maintenance programme is based on an asset management approach. Asset management involves using robust data to make good, informed decisions about how we manage and maintain the highway network as effectively as possible.\nThe priorities for scheme selection are based on a number of weighting factors such as, condition data, number of safety defects, enquiries, location, usage, accident records, hierarchy and affordability.\nHighway Infrastructure and HMEP policies, plans and strategies\nYou can find out more here.",

    "text": "Gullies, also known as drains, are essential components of road drainage systems. They are large pots covered by metal grids and are typically found at the edge of roads. They also exist along kerb lines and are called kerb inlet gullies.\nWhen rainwater falls on roads, it flows into these gullies, which then direct the water to roadside ditches, sewer systems, soakaways, catchpits, and sometimes directly into watercourses.\nMost gullies are connected to public sewers, which handle both foul (sewage) and surface water. These sewers are owned and maintained by local water utility companies.\nCleaning gullies\nKnowsley Council is responsible for cleaning approximately 30,000 gullies on adopted highways. This means that the authority is responsible for maintaining gullies on public roads and pavements.\nIn contrast, gullies and surface water systems on private roads, parking areas, or non-council-maintained land are the responsibility of the landowner.\nIf you experience sewage problems, please contact the relevant water authority or landowner.\nHow often gullies are cleaned\nThe frequency of gully cleaning depends on the type of road:\nGullies on high-speed roads are cleaned twice a year (Priority 1).\nGullies on classified A, B, and C roads are cleaned once a year (Priority 2).\nGullies on unclassified roads are cleaned once every two years (Priority 3).\nIn addition to regular cleaning schedules, gullies are also cleaned when blockages are reported.\nBlocked gullies\nThe council promptly addresses blocked gullies that are reported or identified during routine inspections. The priority for gully cleaning is as follows:\nIf a blocked gully is reported and there are no reports of flooding, the gully will be cleaned within 28 days.\nIf a blocked gully is causing flooding on a highway or a neighbouring property/land, the gully will be cleared within 2-24 hours, depending on the severity of the flooding.\nIf a blocked gully is reported on a Priority 1 or Priority 2 road and there are no reports of flooding, the gully will be cleaned at the next scheduled cleaning. If the next scheduled cleaning is more than 28 days away, a new work request will be raised.\nMaintaining gullies\nIf any problems with gullies are identified during the routine maintenance of adopted highways, these will be investigated and considered as part of the annual Capital Maintenance funding.\nReasons for flooding\nWhile a well-maintained drainage system can effectively manage rainwater, there are some factors that can contribute to flooding:\nMaximum capacity\nThe highway drainage system has a maximum capacity, and if the amount of surface water exceeds this capacity, it may take longer for the water to drain away.\nFree flow of sewer systems, ditches, and watercourses\nKnowsley's highway drainage systems rely on the free flow of sewer systems, ditches, and watercourses. If any of these systems are blocked or not working properly, it can hinder the drainage of rainwater.\nHigh river levels\nWhen river levels are high, surface water may be trapped on the highway until the river levels drop.\nDamaged piped systems\nDamage to piped systems can disrupt the flow of water, leading to flooding. It is crucial to report any damage to pipes promptly.\nReport a problem\nReport a problem with highway drains\nYou can also call\n0800 0232334\n.",

    "text": "Potholes are common occurrences on roads, especially during winter. These depressions in the road surface can pose safety hazards for motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians.\nDefinition of a pothole\nKnowsley Council defines a pothole as a defect in the road surface that is 40mm or more deep. If a section of the road deteriorates but is less than 40mm deep, it is not considered to be a pothole.\nFactors contributing to pothole formation\nSeveral factors contribute to the formation of potholes:\nRoad age and deterioration\nOver time, road surfaces age, becoming less flexible and more susceptible to cracking. This makes them more vulnerable to damage from water, traffic, and extreme temperatures.\nWater ingress\nWater seeping into cracks in the road surface can freeze and expand when temperatures drop. This repeated expansion and contraction process weakens the road surface, leading to potholes.\nHeavy traffic\nHeavy traffic puts excessive wear and tear on road surfaces, accelerating the deterioration process and increasing the likelihood of potholes forming.\nUtility trenches\nExcavation work for utility trenches can disrupt the integrity of the road surface, creating weak spots that can develop into potholes.\nExtreme temperatures\nExtreme heat and cold can also cause the road surface to expand and contract, leading to cracks and potholes.\nIdentifying potholes\nRoads in Knowsley are regularly inspected to ensure they remain in a safe condition. All defects are recorded and repaired in accordance with Knowsley’s policy for highway safety inspections, available to download below.\nDocument\nKnowsley Council Policy for Highway Safety Inspections 2019.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n911.38KB\n)\nThe frequency of inspections is based on the road type and the traffic using it.\nTable 1: Carriageways\nCategory\nCategory name\nShort description\nLong description\nFrequency\n1\nMotorway\nLimited access motorway regulations apply\nRoutes for fast moving long distance traffic.

In some circumstances, a temporary repair is carried out as a short-term measure, with a permanent repair scheduled soon after.\nTemporary repairs will also be considered when there are extensive patching or resurfacing works programmed.\nA typical permanent repair would see the area of the road around the pothole cut out to give a clean vertical edge. Any loose material is removed from the area being repaired and is then painted with liquid bituminous binder. The area is filled with a hot bitumen-bound material, which is raked and compacted to the level of the surrounding road.\nPerformance management\nPerformance will be monitored and managed appropriately with the aim of achieving the following response times:\nResponse category\nResponse times\nTarget % repaired\nCategory 1\n1 - 2 hours\n98%\nCategory 2\n2 - 24 hours\n95%\nCategory 3\n3 - 14 days\n95%\nCategory 4\n4 - 28 days\n95%\nHow repairs are paid for\nPothole inspections and repairs are funded from Knowsley Council’s highway maintenance budget and from the government’s Pothole Action Fund.\nMore information on how and where the pothole action funding was invested in Knowsley\n.\nHow to report a pothole\nPotholes and other defects can happen very fast, and the council may not be aware of them, so any reports are helpful.\nReported defects are assessed, and where they meet the intervention criteria set out in the Highway Safety Inspection Policy, then repairs will be undertaken.\nReport a pothole here\nor contact 0800 0232334.",

    "text": "Building regulations are performance levels set by Parliament that govern the construction of buildings and the installation of certain services. They are designed to safeguard the health and safety of people in or around buildings, as well as promote energy conservation and accessibility for disabled individuals in new offices, shops, and public buildings.\nEnforcement of building regulations is carried out by building control officers, who review plans for compliance and conduct on-site inspections during construction. These regulations apply to the construction of new buildings, extensions or alterations to existing buildings, and changes in building use.\nTo obtain building regulation approval, applicants can choose between two procedures: a full plans application or a building notice. The full plans application requires detailed plans, while the building notice procedure requires less detailed plans. The choice between these two options depends on the complexity of the project and the applicant's experience with construction.\nNeighbours do not have the right to object to building regulation applications. However, objections may be raised under separate legislation, such as the Planning Acts or party wall legislation.\nFees are payable for building regulation applications, except for exempt work. The council will advise applicants of the applicable fee, which may vary depending on the procedure chosen.\nOnce a building notice has been given or full plans have been submitted, work can begin at any time, but the council must be notified two working days in advance. However, starting work before approval is received may limit the applicant's options for disputing a rejection.\nInformation on building standards can be found in approved documents published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office. These documents provide practical guidance on meeting the requirements of the regulations. However, alternative solutions are also acceptable if they can be demonstrated to comply with the regulations.\nIf building plans are rejected, they can be resubmitted with amendments or the matter can be referred to the Secretary of State for the Environment for a determination.\nUnapproved building work may be required to be altered or removed. If the owner fails to comply, the council may serve a notice requiring them to do so.\nUnauthorised building work that commenced on or after November 11, 1985 can now be regularised.\nFor more information, contact building control on 443 2380 or refer to the Building Act 1984, the Building Regulations, and the accompanying Approved Documents. These documents are available at the Building Control office, the Reference Library, and HMSO.\nTo find a registered electrical contractor, visit\nNICEIC.",

In Knowsley, the rock is called Bowland shale.\nKnowsley Council's opposition to fracking\nThe council\nagreed a motion in September 2015\nopposing fracking and other unconventional gas extraction methods in Knowsley and surrounding areas.\nKnowsley Council is opposed to fracking and other unconventional gas extraction methods because:\nThe processes have not been proven to be safe.\nThe potential negative impacts on health and the environment have not been fully addressed.\nThere is no evidence of economic benefits of fracking.\nGovernment's stance on fracking\nThe Government\nsupports\nexploring the potential of shale gas, via methods such as fracking. They have issued licenses for companies to explore for shale gas in different areas of the country, including Knowsley.\nThe Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has issued licences for companies to begin exploring sites across the country for shale gas. In 2015, the Government set up an\nOil and Gas Authority (OGA)\nto oversee oil and gas licensing and development including shale.\nPotential for fracking in Knowsley\nThere is shale rock approximately 1,000 meters beneath Knowsley that is potentially gas-bearing. The full potential of the area is not yet known.\nAn area in the north of the borough, near Tower Hill in Kirkby, is within one of the exploration blocks awarded by the Government in the\nrecent licensing round\n.\nUncertainty of fracking in Knowsley\nThe award of these licenses by the Government does not automatically mean that exploration or drilling for shale gas and/or oil can begin.\nKnowsley Council's authority over fracking applications\nKnowsley's Planning Committee can reject any application for fracking if it considers it does not meet national legislation and planning rules.\nPlanning Committee must consider any application on its merits and the following issues are likely to be of particular relevance to shale gas and/or oil planning applications:\nNoise\nDust\nAir quality\nLighting\nVisual intrusion\nLandscape character\nArchaeological and heritage features\nTraffic\nRisk of contamination of the land\nSoil resources\nThe impact on agricultural land\nFlood risk\nLand stability/subsidence\nInternationally, nationally and locally designated sites and species for nature conservation and biodiversity\nNationally protected geological and geomorphological sites and features\nPlans for site restoration and aftercare\nCumulative or in-combination effects\nThese are some of the main issues and material considerations, alongside national and local policy, upon which the Planning Committee can base its decision whether to grant planning permission, regardless of the council’s opposition to fracking in principle.\nPlanning applications for fracking in Knowsley\nTo date, Knowsley Council has not received any planning applications from companies wishing to carry out investigations, testing, or fracking for shale gas and/or oil in Knowsley.\nFinding out about fracking planning applications\nYou can look at all planning applications submitted to Knowsley Council on the planning section of their website. You can also read the agendas and related reports for meetings of the Planning Committee in this section.\nAdditional information\nFor more information on the Government's stance on fracking, please visit the Department of Energy and Climate Change website.\nFor more information on the Oil and Gas Authority, please visit their website.",

The current planning application fees don't cover the cost of this advice.\nFor each type of development a charge will apply for formal pre-application advice given by the Council. The charges are outlined in detail in the pre-application fee guide. All charges are inclusive of VAT.\nDocument\nPre application fees April 2025.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n32.21KB\n)\nPre-application engagement is not mandatory, but it is strongly encouraged\nEngaging with the Council before submitting a planning application is considered to be best practice. This is because it allows Council officers and developers to work together to ensure that the proposed development is sustainable and in line with local planning policies. Early engagement can also help to avoid additional costs and delays that can arise if problems are not identified early on.\nWhilst we will do our best to work positively and proactively with developers, all advice is given without prejudice to the outcome of any subsequent application. Your planning application will be subject to notification/consultation of interested parties and, dependent on the views expressed, this may affect the outcome of your application.\nWhat you must provide\nDownload and complete the pre-application advise request form.\nDocument\nPre-application advise request form.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n509.21KB\n)\nYou will also need to provide:\nSite location plan at an appropriate scale, usually 1:1250 or 1:2500\nDetails of current use and relevant history.  Photographs can be helpful.\nDetails of the nature and scale of the development proposed.  More information may be required if more detailed advice is requested\nSketch drawings of the proposed development to include a proposed layout, floor plans and elevations, sufficient to indicate the scale and height of development proposed.\na list of any key issues for which you require a specific response\nThe relevant basic fee which must be paid in advance before the request is registered. Where there are additional charges e.g for site meetings or additional meetings or hourly charges an invoice will be sent\nProviding an electronic version of all documents submitted will also enable faster internal consultations by email and help us provide you with a more rapid response.\nPre-application responses\nEach response will be tailored to the scheme proposed. Upon receiving your pre-application form and fee we will telephone you to discuss timescales and the scope of the advice required.\nThe Council has a range of technical specialists. The officer will co-ordinate the input of these specialists, dependent on the scale and nature of the development proposed. They will be invited to attend meetings as considered necessary by the planning officer.\nOther pre-application advice\nKnowsley Council strongly encourages consultation with Merseyside Environmental Advisory Service (MEAS) as part of the pre-application process to help facilitate the development management process where appropriate.  When we receive a request for pre-application advice, if we identify a need, then we may pass details of your pre-application request to MEAS within 24 hours unless you advise otherwise.  You may wish to contact MEAS directly by emailing\nmeasdcconsultations@eas.sefton.gov.uk\nor calling 0151 934 4951.\nWhere to send the required information, form and fee\nPre-application enquiries can either be submitted via email or post.\nEmail\nplanning@knowsley.gov.uk\nBy post\nKnowsley Metropolitan Borough Council\nPO Box 26\nArchway Road\nHuyton\nL36 9FB\nThe fee can be paid\nonline\n, (please ensure, when you have made the payment you forward the confirmation receipt to\ndcsubmissions@knowsley.gov.uk\n) over the phone by contacting 0151 443 2380 or by sending a cheque through the post.",

    "text": "We receive regular Met Office weather forecasts which help us identify when we need to grit. Gritting is usually complete within three hours of operations starting.\nRoads that are gritted\nSix primary routes, covering almost half of the roads in Knowsley, are gritted.  These include:\nM62 motorway (Liverpool boundary to Tarbock Interchange)\nAll strategic routes\nMajor bus routes\nTransport Interchanges and bus stations\nInterconnecting roads within important industrial areas\nRoads leading to ambulance, fire stations and hospitals\nRoads on significant hills/inclines and known trouble spots\nThe Council do not directly treat the footways in wintery conditions as this would be a labour-intensive job. However, when gritting the road network the grit is dispersed across the carriageway and footway.\nOur approach to winter gritting can be found in our Winter Service Policy.\nDocument\nWinter Service Policy Document.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n528.28KB\n)\nRoute maps\nDocument\nGritting routes.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n3.19MB\n)\nDocument\nGritting routes A-Z format.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n141.69KB\n)\nHow we decide which roads to grit\nSchools\nSchools often clear key pathways, access roads, and frontages. In very severe conditions, we may grit outside school gates if enough salt is available.\nMajor retail parks and supermarkets\nMajor retail parks and supermarkets normally grit their car parks and the areas outside their shops.\nGrit bins\nIn the early 2010s a decision was made for all council provided grit bins within the Borough to be removed due to ongoing issues which included being filled with litter, used to conceal illegal substances or people stockpiling grit/padlocking bins preventing others from accessing it.\nGritting product\nWe use a product called Safecote-treated 6mm Thawrox+ to treat the roads. This product has several advantages over regular rock salt:\nIt works longer than regular rock salt.\nIt works at temperatures as low as -10°C (regular rock salt only works down to -6°C).\nLess of the product is needed to treat roads, as it is more effective. This means there is less waste and that gritting vehicles do not need to return to the depot to be reloaded as often.\nSafecote reduces corrosion of the gritting vehicles.\nSafecote improves the distribution of salt on the highway by 35-40% compared to rock salt.\nSafecote allows us to start gritting earlier in the evening than we could with regular rock salt.\nReactive treatment\nIf snow and ice are forecast to last for 24 hours or more, we may consider requests for gritting in specific areas. However, we must balance these requests with our other priorities and our overall gritting schedule.\nWhere conditions of snow and or ice are forecast to persist for 24 hours or longer and where there are resources available, the council will consider requests in the context of competing priorities and programmed gritting operations.  It should be noted that given the limited nature of the financial and other resources involved in delivering the winter service, it is neither reasonable nor possible to treat the entire public highway asset.\nWhat you can do\nYou can help us keep the roads safe during the winter by:\nHaving your own stock of salt to clear your driveway and sidewalk.\nClearing your driveway and sidewalk carefully and taking sensible precautions.\nHelping vulnerable or elderly neighbours clear their driveways and sidewalks.\nOnly driving when absolutely necessary and taking extreme care. Public transport is usually more reliable during the winter, and buses normally travel along main routes that are regularly gritted.\nStaying up-to-date with the weather forecast by watching and listening to local TV and radio stations.\nPlease note that we cannot treat the entire road network due to the limited resources available.\nRepairing damage caused by bad weather\nDamage to roads is caused by water and thawing snow seeping into small cracks in the road. As temperatures dip, the water freezes and expands, enlarging the cracks. This causes cracks and potholes to appear.\nInspection and repair works return the highway to a safe condition as quickly as possible.\nReporting a pothole\nwill help us identify and repair damage more quickly.\nFind out more\nFollow\nKnowsley Council on Facebook\nfor updates.",

These could be details of materials, specifications, plans or a written statement detailing what has, or will be done to comply with the condition.\nOnce submitted we will acknowledge your request and give you the name and contact details of the officer who will be dealing with it.\nCosts\nAs of April 2008, a mandatory national fee is applicable for discharging planning conditions. Please note that we cannot process or review your request to discharge or comply with conditions without receiving the required fee.\nA fee is generally required for most requests to discharge conditions. The current fees for discharging conditions can be found below. The fee applies per request, not per condition, so it's recommended to submit a single application for all conditions you wish to discharge.\nDocument\nApplication fees.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n123.8KB\n)\nPlease note that no fee is charged for Listed Building Consent or Conservation Area Consent permissions. Additionally, requests for confirmation that conditions have been complied with will also incur the appropriate fee.\nHow long it will take\nProcessing times for discharging planning conditions vary depending on the complexity of the application and the availability of necessary information.\nStraightforward cases\nIf your application is straightforward, you have provided all required details, and your proposals are acceptable, we aim to respond within approximately three weeks.\nCases requiring consultation\nIf we need to consult with other parties, the processing time may extend to 8-12 weeks from the date of receiving the fee and necessary details.\nInsufficient or unacceptable details\nIn cases where the provided details are insufficient or unacceptable, we will notify you within twelve weeks that the condition(s) cannot be discharged. You will then need to resubmit new proposals for compliance, accompanied by an additional fee.\nReporting non-compliance with conditions\nIf you are concerned that conditions placed on a planning permission have not been complied with, please see our\nPlanning Enforcement Section\n.",

    "text": "When the Council makes decisions on planning applications, the majority of applications are made by officers under ‘delegated authority’ – only those applications with the greatest public interest tend to be decided by the councillors who sit on the Council’s Planning Committee. The Council’s Constitution sets out how those applications are chosen.\nThe agenda for the Planning Committee is published on the Council’s\ncouncil and elections webpage\nfive working days before the meeting. The majority of Planning Committee meetings are held on Thursdays, so the agenda is typically published on Wednesdays.\nYou can find out if an application that you are interested in will be decided by the Planning Committee by registering to ‘track’ the application on the Council’s\nPlanning Public Access webpage\n.\nWhat happens at the Planning Committee?\nThe agenda for the meeting will include a report for each of the planning applications that will be decided by Planning Committee. The report is prepared by the Council’s expert planning officers and summarises all of the matters that are relevant to deciding the application. The report will weigh up the facts and recommend whether planning permission should be approved or refused.\nPlanning Committee meetings are usually held at 6 pm in the Council Chamber Municipal Building in Huyton Village Town Centre and are ‘live streamed’ on the Council’s website. The meetings are undertaken in accordance with the following procedure:\nThe Chairperson introduces the application.\nA Planning Officer will make a short presentation to members of the Planning Committee based on the agenda report.\nMembers of the public who have registered to speak against the proposed development are invited to address the committee.\nA Planning Officer gives points of clarification on the matters raised.\nCommittee members ask Officers any questions about the objector’s presentation (if Officers are unable to answer, the speaker will be invited to respond, followed by further clarification if required).\nMembers of the public who have registered to speak in favour of the proposed development are invited to address the committee.\nA Planning Officer gives points of clarification on the matters raised.\nCommittee members ask Officers any questions about the supporter’s presentation (if Officers are unable to answer the speaker will be invited to respond, followed by further clarification if required)\nIf they have registered to speak, the applicant or their representative is invited to address the committee.\nA Planning Officer gives points of clarification on the matters raised.\nCommittee members ask Officers any questions about the presentation (if Officers are unable to answer, the speaker will be invited to respond, followed by further clarification if required).\nThe Planning Committee debates the application and asks officers questions.\nThe Planning Committee moves to approve or refuse the application, and a vote is taken.\nThe chairperson informs the meeting of the decision.\nCan I speak at a Planning Committee meeting?\nMeetings of the Planning Committee take part in the Council Chamber in the Municipal Building in Huyton Village Town Centre and are ‘live streamed’ on the Council’s website.\nThe meetings are public, so members of the public can attend and listen to the debate. However, they cannot speak at the meeting unless they have registered to do so.\nAnybody can register to speak at the Planning Committee, but you must register to do so by 12 pm the day before the meeting by emailing\nplanning.speaking@knowsley.gov.uk\nwith the following information:\nYour name, address and telephone number.\nApplication number and details of the relevant application.\nWhether you support or oppose the application.\nIf you are happy for your details to be shared with others who register the same request to speak. This will enable you to arrange who speaks and for how long.\nWhether you are nominating anybody to speak on your behalf. If so, you need to provide their name and contact details.\nYou must provide the details listed above. Please do not seek to use this as an opportunity to restate or add to your representations already made to Planning Services.\nYou can contact Democratic Services on\n0151 443 3582\nbefore the 12 pm deadline to make sure they have received your request. You should allow enough time to comply with the procedure in the event that they have not received your request.\nIf an item is deferred you must register your request to speak again, requests to speak will not be ‘carried over’.\nYou should arrive at the committee meeting at least 15 minutes before it starts and alert the Committee Clerk of your presence.\nWhat matters can I raise?\nThe Planning Committee can only consider certain matters, which are called ‘material planning considerations’. In order to make the best use of your time, you should ensure that your presentation does not include matters that are not material planning considerations.\nIf your presentation includes ‘non-material’ matters, Council Officers will tell the Planning Committee that they must not consider them when deciding the application. There is not an exhaustive list of what are and aren’t material planning considerations, but the\nPlanning Portal\nsets out some common matters.\nImpacts on house prices, loss of a view, the character of an applicant, competition, restrictive covenants, boundary disputes, private rights of access, matters controlled under separate legislation (such as Building Regulations, Environmental Permits etc) are not material considerations.\nHow long will I have to speak?\nThe Council allows public speakers a minimum of 3 minutes; however, for those applications that have generated the most public interest, more time is allocated as set out in the table below (the Chairperson may agree to an extension of speaking times if there are exceptional circumstances).\nFewer than 50 representations**\n51 - 200 representations**\n201 or more representations**\nApplicant\n3 minutes\n5 minutes\n8 minutes\nWard Councillors\n3 minutes\n5 minutes\n8 minutes\nPublic Objectors\n3 minutes\n5 minutes\n8 minutes\nPublic Supporters\n3 minutes\n5 Minutes\n8 minutes\n** A representation is defined as an individual letter (not a circular style letter or petition).\nSpeaking time is evenly distributed between the speakers in each of the categories (e.g. if there are 3 public objectors, they will each be given 1 minute to speak). However, the number of public speakers in each category is capped, so no one person has less than 1 minute to address the committee (i.e. if objectors have 3/5/8 minutes available, only 3/5/8 people can speak in objection to an application). In order to make the best use of the committee’s time, no speaker will be allocated more than 3 minutes.\nIf the number of people registered exceeds the number of slots, then the registered speakers will be given the opportunity to elect a spokesperson. In the unlikely event that they are unable or unwilling to do so, the Committee’s Clerk will draw names from a hat.",

    "text": "About planning enforcement\nPlanning enforcement addresses situations where development has occurred without the necessary permission. This includes:\nUnauthorised construction or extensions\nUnauthorised advertisements\nUnauthorised work on protected trees\nFailure to comply with planning permission conditions\nUnauthorised changes to land or building usage\nUntended or dilapidated land or buildings that negatively impact the surrounding area's visual appeal\nWhen planning enforcement action is taken\nThe council carefully assesses the extent of harm caused or likely to be caused by the unauthorised development before deciding whether to take enforcement action. Harm can result from various factors, such as:\nNoise disturbance or nuisance from business operations\nIncreased traffic flows causing danger and disruption\nLoss of privacy, impact on outlook, overshadowing, and reduced natural light\nAdverse visual impact due to poor design or inappropriate materials\nDamage or loss of protected trees, buildings, or buildings in conservation areas\nPollution risk endangering people or the environment\nDevelopments that undermine the integrity of national and local planning policies\nUntidy land or dilapidated or derelict buildings that negatively impact the surrounding area's visual appeal\nWhat happens when action is taken\nIf planning enforcement action is deemed necessary, the council has a range of statutory powers at its disposal to:\nGather information about the activities and individuals involved\nTake steps to rectify unauthorised developments or uses\nServe statutory notices outlining the necessary actions to remedy the breach of planning control\nUndertake works in default if necessary\nProsecute offenders\nSeek court injunctions\nEnforcement notices\nAn enforcement notice may require one or more of the following:\nCessation or prevention of an activity\nRemoval of an unauthorised building or extension\nModifications to an unauthorised development to make it more compliant\nCompliance with planning conditions\nImprovement in the appearance of land or buildings\nStatutory time limits for enforcement action\nThere are statutory time limits within which enforcement action must be taken. Failure to act within these limits results in the breach becoming immune, and the unauthorised development becomes lawful. For instance:\nEnforcement action against building works or the change of use of a building to a single dwelling, including the subdivision of a house into self-contained flats, cannot be taken if the development occurred more than four years ago.\nThe time limit for other changes of use or non-compliance with planning conditions is ten years.\nThere is no statutory time limit for taking action against breaches of listed building control.\nAnyone receiving an enforcement notice can appeal to the Planning Inspectorate.\nGuidance about making an appeal against an enforcement notice\nis also available on Planning Portal.\nMore information on Planning Enforcement can be found on the Department for Communities and Local Government Website,\nEnsuring Effective Enforcement\nand also by visiting Planning Portal,\nHaving your say\nand\nPlanning permission - your responsibilities\n.\nComplaints\nIf you suspect a planning violation, you must file a written complaint. This helps us clearly identify the location, review records, understand the nature of the complaint, conduct further investigation, and provide an appropriate response.\nWhat to include in your complaint\nDetails of the alleged violation or unauthorised activity\nAddress or location of the alleged violation\nDate when the work or activity first started\nThe harm you feel it causes you and the neighbourhood (include photos if helpful)\nName and contact details of the person(s) carrying out the alleged violation (if known)\nYour name, address, and other contact details (essential)\nPlease note\nAnonymous complaints are not accepted.\nYour complaint will be treated confidentially.\nWe will not disclose any information that could identify you unless required for court proceedings.\nHow we handle complaints\nWe receive many reports of alleged planning violations. Some are very serious and may take a long time to investigate. We prioritise cases based on the severity of the violation and the harm caused.\nNegotiation\nWe may consider negotiation before taking formal action if a successful outcome seems possible within a reasonable timeframe. Negotiation is not appropriate when significant harm is being caused.\nResponse times\nWe will acknowledge your complaint in writing (or by email if provided) within five working days.\nPriority levels\nTop priority\nWe will visit the site within 24 hours for alleged violations that could cause irreversible damage, such as demolition of a listed building or unauthorised work on a protected tree.\nHigh priority\nWe will visit the site within five working days for alleged violations that are serious but less immediate, such as significant unauthorised alterations to a dwelling.\nMedium priority and low priority\nWe will visit the site within 10-15 working days for alleged violations that are less likely to cause serious harm, such as changes of use of land or buildings that violate council policy.\nContact\nPlanning Enforcement\nEmail\nplanning.enforcement@knowsley.gov.uk\nTelephone\n0151 443 2380\nAddress\nKnowsley MBC\nPlanning Services\nNutgrove Villa\nWestmorland Road\nL36 6GA",

They are not council funds, but the contributor’s money which is held by the council to deliver previously agreed projects for the benefit of the community.\nFurther information on the Council’s requirements for S106 planning obligations are set out in the document below.\nDocument\nCouncil Developer’s Contributions Supplementary Planning Document (SPD).pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n14.95MB\n)\nWhat a Section 106 agreement covers\nWhen a planning application is submitted to the council, we will assess whether the effects of the proposed development would have a significant impact on the local area.\nThe need for a S106 will vary depending on the nature of the development and its impacts. The most common obligations include:\nPublic Open Space, delivery, and future maintenance\nAffordable Housing\nDelivery of Social Value\nProvision of infrastructure to provide additional school places\nHighway infrastructure\nTown centre Improvements\nProvision of infrastructure to allow for GP capacity\nOff-site tree planting and ecological mitigation\nPreparation of the Section 106 Agreement\nThe content of the S106 agreement is agreed between the local planning authority and the applicant when the planning application is being considered by the council. The S106 Legal Agreement can be prepared by the council's solicitors and the applicants will be required to pay the solicitor's fees.\nMonitoring Fees\nPlanning law allows Local Authorities to charge a monitoring fee through section 106 planning obligations, to cover the cost of the monitoring and reporting on delivery of that section 106 obligation as described above.\nView the cost of our monitoring fees and other fees.\nDocument\nNEW-Schedule-of-Knowsley-Council-PLANNING-MISC-application-Fees-2023-04-01-(11).pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n186KB\n)\nAnnual infrastructure funding statements\nIn accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations any authority that receives a contribution from development through the levy or section 106 planning obligations must prepare an infrastructure funding statement.\nThe Infrastructure Funding Statement (IFS) is an annual report which provides a summary of all financial and non-financial developer contributions relating to Section 106 Legal Agreements.\nThis report provides an overview of financial contributions the Council has secured through section 106 agreements from new developments for off-site infrastructure works, affordable housing, the provision of education and healthcare and economic development (Social Value) for each reported year.\nWhat information the report provides\nIn summary, the report provides:\nan overview of s106 agreements;\nthe s106 contributions paid to the council in the reported year\nthe s106 contributions spent in the reported year\ns106 contributions secured for future years; and\nprojects delivered in the borough via s106 in the reported year\nThe information included in the report will be updated annually and published on the council’s website. This will ensure the most up to date information on the amount of developer contributions received from new developments in addition to information on where these monies have been spent is readily available to members of the public and other interested parties.\nDownload our Annual Infrastructure Reports\nDocument\nS106 Infrastructure Funding Statement 2021 - 2022.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n303.46KB\n)\nDocument\nS106 Infrastructure Funding Statement 2020 - 2021.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n188.3KB\n)\nDocument\nS106 Infrastructure Funding Statement 2019 - 2020.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n236.04KB\n)",

    "text": "Venture into the heart of Knowsley and discover a network of Public Rights of Way (PRoWs), designated paths that offer a unique opportunity to connect with nature and immerse yourself in the region's rich heritage. These pathways, spanning approximately 53 kilometres, provide access to diverse landscapes, from peaceful woodlands to scenic country trails, offering a haven for walkers, runners, cyclists, and horse riders.\nUnderstanding PRoW classifications\nPRoWs are categorized into four distinct types based on the specific rights granted to the public:\nFootpaths\nPrimarily intended for pedestrians, footpaths are often surfaced with pavement or gravel, providing a comfortable and accessible route for exploring the countryside.\nBridleways\nDesigned for both pedestrians and horse riders, bridleways offer a wider and more rugged terrain, often featuring gates or stiles for controlled access.\nByways\nThese paths accommodate a variety of non-motorised traffic, including pedestrians, horse riders, and cyclists, offering a versatile option for traversing the countryside.\nRestricted Byways\nWhile allowing all forms of non-motorised traffic, restricted byways prohibit vehicles from making anything other than a slow and careful passage, ensuring the preservation of the path's integrity.\nPermissive paths\nBeyond the officially designated PRoWs, landowners may also grant permission for public use of their private land, creating permissive paths. While not legally binding, permissive paths offer an informal alternative for enjoying the countryside. It's advisable to seek permission from the landowner before using a permissive path, as they may impose restrictions or guidelines for safe and respectful use.\nA landowner proposing to create a permissive path should take legal advice in relation to:\nthe Occupiers Liability Act 1957 and\nthe duty of care that landowners are required to extend to visitors on their property\nMaintenance\nThe maintenance of PRoWs is shared between landowners and the local authority. Landowners are responsible for keeping the route free from obstructions and maintaining gates and stiles. The local authority, as the Highway Authority, is responsible for ensuring the overall condition of the path, including clearing surface vegetation, authorising stiles, gates, signposting, and way marking.\nIssues can be reported on the following number and email address:\nTelephone\n0151 443 3100\nEmail\nhighways@knowsley.gov.uk\nDevelopment and PRoW considerations\nDuring any development project, it's crucial to identify and respect the presence of PRoWs. Obstructing or altering a PRoW is a legal offense that could delay or hinder the completion of development plans.\nThe\ngovernment website\noffers guidance notes on this issue.\nLandowners and the council making additional routes\nLandowners and the Council can make available for public to use in the following ways:\nPublic Path Creation Agreements\nWhere the Council and a landowner agree they can enter into a public path creation agreement under Section 25 of the Highways Act 1980 for the voluntary dedication of a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway as a highway maintainable at the public expense.\nThe landowner can specify the status of the route they wish to dedicate, for example, footpath, bridleway or restricted byway and include existing limitations such as gates, stiles or width restrictions in the agreement.\nThe Council will require anyone dedicating a new route by a creation agreement to show that they have the power to do so. This usually means supplying proof of ownership of the land in question.\nNotice of a creation agreement must be advertised in at least one local newspaper\nThe power to enter into a creation agreement is a discretionary one.  When deciding whether to enter into a creation agreement the Council will take into account factors including the benefit to the public of the public right of way which the landowner will dedicate, and the costs to the Council of bringing the right of way into public use.\nPublic Path Creation Orders\nWhere a new public right of way is needed by the public, section 26 of the 1980 Highways Act gives local councils compulsory powers for the creation of footpaths,  bridleways and restricted byways.\nUnder section 28 of the Highways Act compensation may be payable to any relevant parties for loss caused by a public path creation order.\nWhen deciding whether to make a public path creation order the Council must consider both:\nthe extent to which the path or way would add to the convenience or enjoyment of a substantial section of the public, or to the convenience of residents in the area; and\nthe effect that the creation of the path would have on the rights of those interested in the land, taking into account the fact that compensation may be paid parties who suffer loss as a result and balance the public interest in the path being created against the private interest of the landowner/occupier.\nA creation order can be unconditional or subject to limitations or conditions.\nAnyone may object to a creation order.  If objections are lodged and not withdrawn, the Secretary of State will call a public inquiry or a public hearing to determine whether the creation order should be confirmed.\nIf a creation order is confirmed the route will become a highway maintainable at the public expense.\nLand protection / Landowners Deposits\nNew Rights Of Way can be created through 20 years of unchallenged public use of paths.  However Section 31(6) of the Highways Act 1980, allows landowners to show that they accept the Public Rights Of Way already recorded over their land, but, do not intend to dedicate any new ones by depositing a Statement and plan with the Council.  Within 20 years a landowner may deposit a Highway Declaration to confirm that no new Rights of Way have been dedicated since the date of the deposit of the map and Statement.  Any public use of the land during this period will not count towards the establishment of a new Public Right Of Way.  These Landowner Deposits are available for public inspection.\nSection 15A of the Commons Act 2006 now allows landowners to protect themselves against claims for village green rights over their land, in a similar way.  The deposits under these two sections have been combined into Application Form CA16, and landowners can use all or only part of the form, depending on what rights they wish to claim.  The forms need to be renewed every 20 years.\nThe application Form CA16, including Guidance notes,\ncan be found on the following government website here\n.\nFees\nThere is a charge for registering the Landowner Deposits to cover the Council’s costs of logging the application, making it available on our website and register, placing notices on site and sending notifications, in line with the regulations.\nFor details,\nplease see the Council’s webpage here.\nRegister Section 31(6) Highways Act 1980\nThe Council is required to keep a public register of highway statements and highway declarations that have been deposited under Section 31(6) of the 1980 Highways Act.  These statements and declarations enable landowners to formally acknowledge public rights of way across their land and, in doing so, create a presumption that they have no intention to dedicate any further routes across their land.\nThe Register contains deposits received since 1 October 2013.\nEach deposit can be viewed below, or the paper copy can be viewed, by appointment.\nTo arrange an appointment or for any other enquiries, please contact us\nhighwaydc@knowsley.gov.uk\nRegister 31 (6) and all submissions\nRef.no.\nDeposit Date\nSite Notices: CA17\nDocument\nAA - Register 31(6) Highways Act 1980 – all applications.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n183.98KB\n)\n-\n-\n-\nDocument\nRed Cut Lane, Kirkby and Cronton Hall Sewage Works, Cronton.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n648.52KB\n)\n2017/2\n7/6/17\nDocument\nCA17-Notice-Cronton-Hall-and-Red-Cut-Ln-ref-2017-2-pdf.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n204.06KB\n)\nDocument\nWheathill Farm, Huyton, Hall Lane, Cronton and Norland’s Lane, Cronton.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n695.94KB\n)\n2017/1\n7/6/17\nDocument\nCA17-Notice-Norlands-Ln-and-Wheathill-Rd-ref-2017-1-pdf.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n206.51KB\n)\nDocument\nDeclaration - Red Cut Lane, Kirkby and Cronton Hall Sewage Works, Cronton.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n505.3KB\n)\n2017/2\n18/12/17\nDocument\nCA17-Notice-Declaration-ref-2017-2-PDF_1.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n203.48KB\n)\nDocument\nDeclaration - Wheathill Farm, Huyton, Hall Lane, Cronton and Norlands Lane, Cronton.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n576.14KB\n)\n2017/1\n18/12/17\nDocument\nCA17-Notice-Declaration-ref-2017-1-PDF.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n206.69KB\n)\nApply for a Definitive Map Modification Order under Section 53(2) Wildlife Countryside Act 1981\nYou may wish to apply for a definitive map modification order (DMMO) if you have evidence that:\nA path or way that you and others have been using as a right of way for years is not shown\nA path shown with a particular description should be shown as a highway of a different description, for example where a footpath has been used for many years by horse riders and you wish to apply to have it recorded as a bridleway\nThere is no public right of way over land shown in the map and statement of any description, or it is in the wrong place\nAny other particulars in the map and statement require modification.\nThe evidence may be in the form of historical documents or use by the public, or both.

    "text": "Scrutiny is in place for the benefit of the community at large.  It is designed to support and enhance decision-making processes.  Scrutiny involves non-executive elected members reviewing and scrutinising the whole range of the council’s functions and responsibilities, including those delivered in partnership with other agencies and organisations.\nScrutiny aims to make a positive impact on the economic, social and environmental well-being of those who live, work and visit the borough of Knowsley by supporting the development of policy, monitoring performance, and making important recommendations to support improvement.\nHow scrutiny is structured in Knowsley\nScrutiny in Knowsley consists of five themed committees, each with its own areas of responsibility that have been aligned with the priorities of the Council’s Corporate Plan. The five Scrutiny committees are;\nChildren\nHealth and Adult Social Care\nInclusive Growth and Skills\nStronger Communities\nClimate Emergency\nEach committee is responsible for coordinating its activity and ensuring it meets its obligations.  They each comprise of Elected Members, with both the Children Scrutiny Committee and the Health and Adult Social Care Scrutiny Committee also having co-opted Members who serve on the committees alongside the elected members.\nHow scrutiny works\nAt the beginning of the municipal year, opinions are sought from elected Members, officers, partners and members of the public for suggestions of topics/ areas that they feel would benefit from being ‘scrutinised.’\nThe list of suggestions is then taken to a work-planning session involving all elected Members, who then select one area/ topic for each committee that will be the subject of an in-depth review.\nEach committee will meet four times yearly in addition to the chosen task and finish review activity.\nTask and finish reviews\nA task and finish review involves committee members carrying out activity away from the formal setting of a committee meeting to tackle issues head-on, gathering evidence to inform findings and recommendations to be included in a final review report. This could involve working group sessions, site visits and surveys/ questionnaires. After they are finalised, review reports are then taken to Cabinet for consideration and to seek approval of action to be taken forward in response to its recommendations.\nTask and Finish Reports\nChildren Scrutiny Committee Task and Finish Review into Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) Provision\nHealth and Adult Social Care Scrutiny Committee Task and Finish Review into Respite Services Final Report\nInclusive Growth and Skills Scrutiny Committee Task and Finish Review into Strategic Housing\nStronger Communities Scrutiny Committee Task and Finish Review into Creating a Volunteer Network\nScheduled committee meetings\nCommittee meetings provide the opportunity for Members to look at other topics, to receive reports on the progress being made on tackling issues and to be consulted on decisions due to be made or draft policies/ strategies.\nIndividual committees can decide to include in their work plan for the year topics not selected to be the subject of a task and finish review.  These topics would then be included as items on scheduled committee agendas.\nScheduled committee meetings can also be used as a platform for holding decision-makers (council and partners) to account for what they have done. You can find out more information on committee structures\nhere\n.\nAnnual Report\nView the Scrutiny Annual Report for 2023/24\n.\nGetting involved\nIf you are interested and would like to get more involved or make suggestions for future issues to be considered by Scrutiny, please write to us at:\nScrutiny and Partnership Team, Municipal Buildings, Archway Road, Huyton, L36 9Y\nOr email:\nscrutiny@knowsley.gov.uk",

Failure to do so could result in a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) of £50 or £70 (reduced to £25 or £35 if paid within 14 days), respectively. The national government sets these penalty charges.\nTake a look at the Guide to Parking Enforcement below to find out more.\nDocument\nGuide to Parking Endforcement.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n550.9KB\n)\nDisabled parking\nDisabled spaces are clearly marked. Blue badge holders are allowed one additional hour in addition to the standard maximum parking times.\nPlease note that currently, those with blue badges will be able to use them to park in appropriate locations for an additional four months beyond the expiration date displayed on the badge. No enforcement action will be taken in these circumstances, as long as the full blue badge (including the correctly set clock) is properly displayed in the vehicle. This concession is in place while the Council addresses the high volume of blue badge applications in the system, and it is likely to be reviewed in the future.\nPlease note this applies only when parking on car parks operated by Knowsley Council, and you may be penalised by landowners if displaying an expired blue badge when parking elsewhere.\nCouncil car park locations\nHuyton\nLathom Road multi-storey car park (short stay: levels 1 and 2, long stay: levels 3 – 7)\nSee disability access information\nArchway Road (short stay)\nHuyton Hey (long stay)\nRed, Green and Brown Zone (long stay, also available as short stay at weekends)\nDocument\nHuyton-Parking-Map.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n5.64MB\n)\nCar parks open to the public but privately owned are also available at:\nClub 3000 Bingo, Ellison Grove (charge)\nCavendish Walk underground, Lathom Road (charge)\nASDA Supermarket, Huyton Lane (no charge, maximum 3 hours)\nKirkby\nKirkby multi-storey car park, Norwich Way (short stay: levels 1 – 2, long stay: levels 3 – 8)\nKirkby Town Centre (short stay)\nKirkby Market (short stay, maximum 1 hour)\nKirkby Centre (short stay)\nCherryfield Drive (short and long stay areas – please see local signage)\nSt Chads Drive (long stay)\nTelegraph Way (long stay)\nCar parks open to the public but privately owned are also available at:\nB & M Store car park (short stay, 90 mins)\nMcDonalds (short stay, 90 mins)\nDocument\nKirkby town centre parking map.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.67MB\n)\nPrescot\nMill Street (short stay)\nPrescot Shopping Centre (short and long stay available)\nCyprus Street (short and long stay available)\nMoss Street (short and long stay available)\nCar parks open to the public but privately owned are also available at:\nCables Shopping Park (no charge)\nDeanes House (charge)\nChatwin’s Bakery (charge)\nMcDonalds (short stay, 90 mins)\nDocument\nPrescot Car Park Map.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n367.31KB\n)\nCycle park locations\nSecure bicycle parking is available at designated locations across Knowsley:\nCronton\nThe Shopping Parade\nParish Council\nHalewood\nHalewood Leisure Centre\nHalewood Library\nHalewood Primary Care Centre\nHalewood Train Station\nHalewood Environment Centre\nNew Hutte Neighbourhood Centre\nHuyton\nOpposite the War Memorial\nHuyton Train Station\nKing George V Sports Complex\nKnowsley Leisure and Culture Park\nHuyton Library\nHuyton Municipal Buildings\nHuyton Shopping Centre\nBluebell Lane Medical Practice\nAldi / Starbucks / KFC / Shell Coppice Lane\nTesco PFS Cronton Road\nKMBC Stretton Way\nAsda Super Centre\nHuyton Primary Care Centre\nHillside Road Shopping Parade\nAcacia Avenue Shopping Parade\nKnowsley Community College\nDinas Lane Medical Centre\nCourt Hey Park\nRoby Train Station\nKirkby\nAdmin Road / South Boundary Road\nKirkby Town Centre\nKirkby Library\nKirkby Train Station\nBewley Drive Shopping Parade\nBroad Lane Shopping Parade\nCopple House Lane Shopping Parade\nGlovers Brow Shopping Parade\nOld Rough Lane Shopping Parade\nPark Brow Drive Shopping Parade\nJames Holt Avenue Shopping Parade\nKennelwood Avenue Shopping Parade\nLoweswater Way Shopping Parade\nOld Farm Road Shopping Parade\nRichard Hesketh Drive\nCentre 63\nKnowsley Village\nKnowsley Village Hall\nSugar Lane Shopping Parade\nPage Moss\nNorth Huyton Primary Care Resource Centre (Page Moss)\nRiver Alt Resource Centre\nPrescot\nCables Retail Park\nPrescot Shopping Centre\nPrescot Town Centre Eccleston Street\nPrescot Town Hall\nShakespeare North Playhouse\nPrescot Train Station\nPrescot Soccer Centre\nPrescot Parkway at Home Bargains\nStockbridge Village\nStockbridge Village Library and Shopping Centre\nPrimary Care Resource Centre (Stockbridge)\nLeisure Centre\nTarbock\nParish Council Building\nWhiston\nWhiston Hospital\nWarrington Road Shopping Parade\nWhiston Town Council and Community Centre\nWhiston Primary Care Centre and Pharmacy\nWhiston Train Station\nMilton Avenue Shopping Parade\nWhiston Village (Greenes Road)\nGetting around in Knowsley\nIf you want to know more about cycling in Knowsley, as well as walking and public transport in Knowsley travel information page\nGetting Around in Knowsley\n.",

If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements,\ncontact us\n.\nEnforcement procedure\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re unhappy with how we respond to your complaint,\ncontact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)\n.\nTechnical information about this website’s accessibility\nKnowsley Council is committed to making its website accessible under the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.\nCompliance status\nThis website is partially compliant with the\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1\nAA standard, due to the non-compliances and exemptions.\nNon-accessible content\nThe content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.\nNon-compliance with the accessibility regulations\nThis website is in active development, and non-compliant issues detected in our testing will be resolved in order of impact and difficulty.\nContent that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations\nPDFs\nMany of our older PDFs and Word documents do not meet accessibility standards - for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role value). For example:\nThey currently don't use the correct heading structure, which makes it difficult for screen reader users to navigate the document. This fails WCAG success criterion 1.3.1 (Info & Relationships)\nThere are no bookmarks in the PDFs, which makes it difficult for screen reader users to discern the structure of the document. This fails WCAG success criterion 2.4.5 (Multiple Ways)\nSome PDFs are missing document titles, which can make it difficult for screen reader users to discern the contents of the document quickly. This fails WCAG success criterion 2.4.2 (Headings and labels)\nSome of our PDFs and Word documents are essential to providing our services. For example, we have PDFs with information on how users can access our services and forms published as Word documents.\nThe accessibility regulations\ndo not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018\nif they’re not essential to providing our services.\nWe endeavour to ensure that any new PDFs we publish meet accessibility standards, and we are also developing ways to publish files in accessible HTML formats.\nWhat we’re doing to improve accessibility\nThis website is built using open-source technology provided by the\nLocalGov Drupal\nproject. It is continuously being reviewed and improved to resolve outstanding accessibility issues and provide a greater resource to identify and resolve any new issues that occur.\nPDFs\nAll PDFs are checked for accessibility compliance before being uploaded to this site.\nPDF documents that were uploaded before 23 September 2018 and therefore fall outside of the scope of the accessibility regulations are made available in accessible formats upon request.\nWhere possible, information is presented as an HTML web page or accessible Word document instead of a PDF.\nPreparation of this accessibility statement\nThis statement was prepared on 02 January 2024. It replaces an earlier version of our Accessibility Statement, which was published on 10 January 2022.\nThis website was last tested on 02 January 2024. The test was carried out by\nSilktide's\nautomated services.\nTesting\nWe tested 1.314 pages covering all areas of the site, only excluding programmatically generated URLs containing duplicated content (such as URLs of filtered directory content).",

    "text": "Young carers are children and young people who look after someone in their family who has an illness, a disability, or is affected by mental ill-health or substance misuse. Young Carers often take on practical and/or emotional caring responsibilities that would normally be expected of an adult.\nIn partnership with Vibe, we take a whole family approach to assessing and supporting carers, providing support wherever possible. This may include a trip or activity for peer support or a one-to-one chat with trained workers.  We support families to ensure that they receive a full package of help that they require, making sure all the relevant services are involved.  This helps to ensure that young carers do not need to take on inappropriate levels of care that could be detrimental to their own health and well-being.\nThe young carer assessment is child-friendly and easily accessible and incorporates many elements of All About Me. Assessments often provide considerable insight into not only the wishes and feelings of children but also their perceptions, which can improve and inform current support plans.\nThe service also works alongside schools in Knowsley to promote and identify Young Carers. This involves raising awareness through assemblies, training with teaching staff and through the promotion of the Young Carers Schools Award.\nCriteria\nAll answers must be YES to meet the criteria for the young person:\nYoung person aged between 6-18 years old\nLives in Knowsley Borough\nIs aware of the referral, and parent/guardian consent has been given\nCares for a family member (parent/sibling/other relative)\nContact\nEmail:\nKnowsley.YoungCarers@knowsley.gov.uk\n‘Me Time’ programme - Help for young carers\nKnowsley Young Carers can access the 'Me Time' programme, which is a session for local young carers to take a break from caring for family members. The session runs Mondays and Wednesdays from various sites in Knowsley, providing opportunities for young carers to get involved in new and exciting activities such as Camp craft, orienteering, water sports and other outdoor education activities, Cultural trips such as visiting theatres and cinema or taking part in more mainstream sports such as football, netball etc. Or you can just come and chill with your friends and the youth workers and maybe try some generic youth activities.\nTo get involved, please contact Steven Blackhurst\nPhone: 07585 987 447\nEmail:\nsteven.blackhurst@vibeuk.org\nAlternatively – contact Sharon McGinnity\nPhone: 07775 221 879\nEmail:\nSharon.mcginnity@vibeuk.org",

    "text": "Non-Domestic Rates\nNon-Domestic Rates, or business rates, collected by local authorities are the way that those who occupy non-domestic property contribute towards the cost of local services. Under the business rates retention arrangements introduced from 1st April 2013, authorities keep a proportion of the business rates paid locally. The money, together with revenue from council taxpayers, locally generated income and grants from central government, is used to pay for the services provided by local authorities in your area.\nFurther information about the non-domestic rates system can be found on the Government's website\nas well as here on the Knowsley Council website. Alternatively, you can contact us directly.\nApart from properties that are exempt from business rates, each non-domestic property has a rateable value which is set by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), an agency of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. They compile and maintain\na full list of all rateable values\n. The rateable value of your property is shown on the front of your bill. This broadly represents the yearly rent the property could have been let for on the open market on a particular date specified in legislation. For the current rating list, this date was set as 1st April 2021.\nThe VOA may alter the valuation if circumstances change. The ratepayer (and certain others who have an interest in the property) can also check and challenge the valuation shown in the list if they believe it is wrong. Further information about the grounds on which challenges may be made and the process for doing so can be obtained by contacting the VOA, or\nby consulting the VOA website\n.\nNon-Domestic Rates Instalments\nPayment of non-domestic rate bills is automatically set on a 10-monthly cycle. However, the Government has put in place regulations that allow businesses to require their local authority to enable payments to be made through 12 monthly instalments. If you wish to take up this offer, you should contact Knowsley Council as soon as possible.\nNational Non-Domestic Rating Multiplier\nKnowsley Council calculates the non-domestic rate bill for a property by multiplying the rateable value of the property by the appropriate non-domestic multiplier. There are two multipliers: the standard non-domestic rating multiplier and the small business non-domestic rating multiplier. The Government sets the multipliers for each financial year, except in the City of London where special arrangements apply.\nRatepayers who occupy a property with a rateable value which does not exceed £50,999 will have their bills calculated using the lower small business non-domestic rating multiplier, rather than the standard non-domestic rating multiplier. Both multipliers for a financial year are based on the previous year's multiplier adjusted to reflect the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation figure for the September prior to the billing year, unless a lower multiplier is set by the Government. The current multipliers are shown on the front of your demand notice (bill).\nRateable Value\nApart from properties that are exempt from business rates, each non-domestic property has a rateable value which is set by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), an agency of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. They compile and maintain a full list of all rateable values, available at\nwww.gov.uk/voa\n. The rateable value of your property is shown on the front of your bill. This broadly represents the yearly rent the property could have been let for on the open market on a particular date specified in legislation. For the current rating list, this date was set as 1st April 2021.\nThe VOA may alter the valuation if circumstances change. The ratepayer (and certain others who have an interest in the property) can also check and challenge the valuation shown in the list if they believe it is wrong. Further information about the grounds on which challenges may be made and the process for doing so can be obtained by contacting the VOA, or by consulting the VOA website at:\nwww.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-check-your-rateable-value-is-correct\n.\nRevaluations\nAll non-domestic property rateable values are reassessed at revaluations. The most recent revaluation took effect from 1st April 2023. Revaluations ensure that non-domestic rate bills are up-to-date and more accurately reflect current rental values and relative changes in rents. Frequent revaluations ensure the system continues to be responsive to changing economic conditions.\nNon-Domestic Rate Reliefs\nDepending on individual circumstances, a ratepayer may be eligible for a rate relief (i.e. a reduction in their business rates bill). There are a range of available reliefs. Further details are provided below and\non the Government website\n, or by contacting your Knowsley Council.\nTemporary Reliefs\nSome of the permanent reliefs are set out below but other temporary reliefs may be introduced by the Government at a fiscal event. Further detail on current temporary reliefs is available at:\nwww.gov.uk/apply-for-business-rate-relief\n. You should contact Knowsley Council for details on the latest availability of non-domestic rate reliefs and advice on whether you may qualify.\nSmall Business Rates Relief\nIf a ratepayer's sole or main property has a rateable value which does not exceed a set threshold, the ratepayer may receive a percentage reduction in their rate bill for the property of up to a maximum of 100%. The level of reduction will depend on the rateable value of the property. For example, eligible properties with a rateable value below a specified lower threshold will receive 100% relief while eligible properties above the lower threshold and below a specified upper threshold may receive partial relief. The relevant thresholds for relief are set by the Government by order and can be obtained from Knowsley Council or\non the Government's website\n. Generally, these percentage reductions (reliefs) are only available to ratepayers who occupy either-\n(a) one property, or\n(b) one main property and other additional properties providing those additional properties each have a rateable value which does not exceed the limit set by order.\nThe aggregate rateable value of all the properties mentioned in (b), must also not exceed an amount set by order. For those businesses that take on an additional property which would normally have meant the loss of small business rate relief, they will be allowed to keep that relief for a fixed additional period. Full details on the relevant limits in relation to second properties and the current period for which a ratepayer may continue to receive relief after taking on an additional property can be obtained from Knowsley Council or\non the Government's website\n.\nCertain changes in circumstances will need to be notified to Knowsley Council by the ratepayer who is in receipt of relief (other changes will be picked up by the Council). The changes which should be notified are-\n(a) the property falling vacant,\n(b) the ratepayer taking up occupation of an additional property, or\n(c) an increase in the rateable value of a property occupied by the ratepayer in an area other than the area of the local authority which granted the relief.\nCharity and Community Amateur Sports Club Relief\nCharities and registered Community Amateur Sports Clubs are entitled to 80% relief where the property is occupied by the charity or the club and is wholly or mainly used for the charitable purposes of the charity (or of that and other charities), or for the purposes of the club (or of that and other clubs).\nKnowsley Council has discretion to give further relief on the remaining bill. Full details can be obtained from Knowsley Council.\nTransitional Rate Relief\nAt a revaluation, some ratepayers will see reductions or no change in their bill whereas some ratepayers will see increases. Transitional relief schemes are introduced at each revaluation to help those facing increases. Transitional relief is applied automatically to bills. Further information about transitional arrangements may be obtained from the local authority or\non the Government's website\n.\nLocal Discounts and Hardship Relief\nLocal authorities have a general power to grant discretionary local discounts and to give hardship relief in specific circumstances. Full details can be obtained from Knowsley Council.\nUnoccupied Property Rating\nNon-Domestic Rates are generally payable in respect of unoccupied non-domestic property. However, they are generally not payable for the first three months that a property is empty. This is extended to six months in the case of certain industrial premises, whilst certain other properties such as vacant listed buildings are not liable for business rates until they are reoccupied. Full details on exemptions can be obtained from Knowsley Council or\non the Government's website\n.\nSubsidy Control\nThe new UK subsidy control regime commenced from 4 January 2023. The new regime enables public authorities, including devolved administrations and local authorities, to deliver subsidies that are tailored for local needs. Public authorities giving subsidies must comply with the UK’s international subsidy control commitments. The subsidy control legislation provides the framework for a new, UK-wide subsidy control regime.\nRead more information about subsidy control\n.\nRating Advisers\nRatepayers do not have to be represented in discussions about the rateable value of their property or their rates bill. However, ratepayers who do wish to be represented should be aware that members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS website:\nwww.rics.org\n) and the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation (IRRV website:\nwww.irrv.org.uk\n) are qualified and are regulated by rules of professional conduct designed to protect the public from misconduct.\nBefore you employ a rating adviser or company you should check that they have the necessary knowledge and expertise, as well as appropriate indemnity insurance. Take great care and, if necessary, seek further advice before entering into any contract.\nInformation Supplied with Demand Notices\nInformation relating to the relevant and previous financial years in regard to the gross expenditure of Knowsley Council is available at:\nwww.knowsley.gov.uk\n. A hard copy is available on request by writing to the Non-Domestic Rate Team at Knowsley Council or by calling: 0151 443 4069.",

    "text": "We know from talking to our residents, that people want to live independently, in their own homes, for as long as possible and that carers play a vital role in making sure this happens.\nIn Adult Social Care, our approach is focused on early intervention and prevention by providing a wide range of support options to carers from information and advice to practical support and specialist assessment.\nKnowsley Carers Hub offers a wide range of support for carers, including information and advice, drop-in sessions, practical support and events and trips. You can refer yourself to the carers' hub by contacting them on 0151 549 1412.\nThere is also a lot of support in the local community and you can see what support is available by searching the\nLive Well Directory\nor call Healthy Knowsley on 0800 0731202 for things that are available in your area.\nAbout carer's assessments\nA carers assessment is the way we decide if your caring role means you have needs that we can support you with, this is called being eligible for support. During the assessment, we will have a conversation with you about what things you about your needs, how your caring role affects you and how we can support you to improve your wellbeing.\nWho is eligible for a carer's assessment\nAny carer who has needs for support should be offered or can request an assessment.\nAs a carer you will be entitled to an assessment regardless of the amount or type of care you provide, your financial means or your level of need for support. You can have an assessment whether or not the person you care for has had a social care needs assessment, or if they are eligible for support or not.\nIf you share caring responsibilities with another person, or more than one person, you can each have a carer's assessment. You don’t have to live with the person you are looking after or be caring full-time to have a carer's assessment. You may be juggling work and care and this is having a big impact on your life.\nHow to request a carers assessment\nYou can request a carer's assessment at any time, even if you have previously declined an assessment or the person you care for has not been assessed.\nTo request an assessment you can contact Knowsley Carers Hub on 0151 549 1412 who will offer you support as an informal carer. If Knowsley Carers Hub feels you need more support than they can offer, they will complete a referral for a carers assessment by the Council.\nYou can request an assessment before you take up your caring role.\nRespite breaks\nEligibility for respite is decided using a social care needs assessment for the cared for person.  You can request a social care needs assessment by contacting our First Response Team on 0151 443 2600.  The cared for person may be charged for any support provided, including respite, following a social care needs assessment.\nWho carries out the carer's assessment\nThe carers assessment is carried out by a suitably trained practitioner who will contact you to arrange the assessment at a time that is convenient to you.\nSupport during your assessment\nYes, you can have people with you to support you and offer their views. This could be a family member or friend, or anyone else that you trust.\nIf you think will find the carers assessment process difficult and you don’t have anyone to help you, we can arrange for someone called an advocate to attend the assessment to help you get your views across.  If you think this would be helpful you can let us know when we contact you to arrange the assessment or you can contact the advocacy hub on 0151 426 3174 and tell them you need help with a carers assessment.\nWhat happens during a carer's assessment\nDuring the assessment we will ask you questions about your strengths, interests and what you like to do.  We will ask about your caring role and how it affects you.\nIn preparation for your assessment, it is useful to give yourself some time to think about how caring affects you. It is also important to start thinking about any help that would make a difference to you as a carer. You can request a copy of the assessment questions in advance and begin to write down your thoughts to these questions.\nThe assessment is the way we decide if your needs as a carer make you eligible for support from Knowsley Council.\nTo be eligible you must meet criteria that is set out in The Care Act\nAs a result of your caring role you physical or mental health is deteriorating or is at risk of deteriorating\nAND\nYou are unable to achieve any of the below outcomes:\nCarrying out any caring responsibilities the carer has for a child\nProviding care to other persons for whom the carer provides care\nMaintaining a habitable home environment in the carer’s home (whether this is also the home of the adult needing care)\nmanaging and maintaining nutrition\nDeveloping and maintaining family or other personal relationships\nEngaging in work, training, education or volunteering\nMaking use of necessary facilities or services in the local community, including recreational facilities or services\nEngaging in recreational activities.\nWhat happens after the carer's assessment\nIf your carer’s assessment identifies that you are eligible we will make a support plan with you.\nThis will give details of the care and support to be provided to you in your caring role and what support we have agreed you need to carry on in your role.\nYour carer's assessment should include arrangements for emergency situations, for example if you become ill.\nFunding\nThere is no charge for a carer's assessment or for information and advice provided to carers.\nIf you receive services from a local voluntary organisation, these are generally provided free of charge.\nWe will meet any cost of services we agree you need as part of your support plan.  If the person you are caring for requires respite this will be part of their own support plan and there may be a charge for this.\nReviewal of your support plan\nYou can request a review of your support plan and a reassessment every 12 months.  To request a review contact Knowsley Carers Hub on 0151 549 1412.\nWhat happens if you are not eligible for support\nIf you are not eligible for care and support, we will send you a letter with our decision and a copy of the assessment.\nWe will give you advice on other services you can use and information about how to get help in future.  The Carers Hub will continue to offer you support and can refer for another assessment if your circumstances change.\nThere is a lot of support for carers in Knowsley and you can find out what is available in your area using the\nLive Well Directory\n.\nYou can also ring Healthy Knowsley to speak to one of their wellbeing coaches on 0800 0731 202.\nWhat happens if I am unhappy with the outcome?\nIf you are unhappy with the outcome, you can\nmake a complaint to the council\n, or contact us by telephone on 0151 443 3231\nYou can also contact Healthwatch Knowsley to raise a concern about the social care assessment process by\nvisiting their website\nor call 0151 449 3954.\nCarers and safeguarding\nIt is important to be aware that you, or the person you support, may be vulnerable to harm at times.

The sight of a damaged or slowly rusting car can also be an eyesore in your community, so, understandably, you might want it to be removed.\nAbandoned and nuisance vehicles can often be confused. Just because a vehicle is in poor condition or out of tax does not always mean it is abandoned. So, on occasions, additional enquiries may have to be made to find out if the vehicle really is abandoned before the Council can remove it.\nIf the vehicle is abandoned, we will place a notice on the vehicle to inform the owner that the vehicle will be removed within 15 days of the notice being placed if, within that time, there has been no contact from the owner and the vehicle is still present, we will instruct a third-party contractor to remove the vehicle.\nBefore continuing to report the vehicle as abandoned, please check the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) website by clicking\nhere\nto find out if the vehicle is taxed.\nIf the vehicle is not taxed, you need to report this directly to the DVLA by visiting their website and following the instructions set out on their\nwebsite\n. The report is anonymous and will be investigated by the DVLA.\nAll vehicles that are not abandoned but are causing an obstruction or are dangerously parked, irrespective of whether the vehicle is taxed or not, must be reported to Merseyside Police, who can arrange for the vehicle to be dealt with immediately.\nFor further information, please visit the\nMerseyside Police website\nor call the non-emergency contact number 101.\nHow to report an abandoned vehicle to Knowsley Council\nIf the vehicle fits the above criteria for an abandoned vehicle and you have checked the DVLA website to confirm if the vehicle is taxed, then please click the link below and complete the online form to report the abandoned vehicle to us; you will need to provide details such as:\nThe location of the vehicle\nThe make, model and colour\nThe registration number\nThe state of the vehicle, including any damage\nHow long it has been there\nPlease have these details ready to complete the form.\nStart here",

    "text": "Harmful Practices\nHarmful practices are forms of violence and abuse and care committed primarily against women and girls as part of accepted cultural practices.  The most common forms of harmful practices are: forced marriage, honour-based abuse and female genital mutilation.\nAbout honour-based abuse\nHonour-based violence (HBV) is any type of violence that is committed against someone because their family or community believes they have brought shame or dishonour to them. HBV can include forced marriage, FGC, and other types of violence, such as beatings, murder, and threats.\nForced marriage\nA forced marriage is a marriage that takes place without the full and free consent of both parties. This means that one or both of the people involved are being pressured or forced to marry against their will.\nFemale genital mutilation (FGM)\nFGM is any procedure that involves the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs. It is a harmful practice that can cause serious physical and psychological health problems. FGM is sometimes referred to as cutting within affected communities.\nConsent of the parents is required because the girl is a minor. When performed on an adult with consent, the procedure is usually described as clitoridectomy or may be part of labiaplasty or vaginoplasty. It does not apply to sex reassignment surgery or the genital modification of intersex individuals.\nFGM is mainly practised in North East Africa and some areas of East and South East Asia. FGM is illegal in the UK\nWhat you can do\nIf you or someone you know is being abused, there are things you can do to get help.\nIf you or someone you know is being forced to marry, you can contact the Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) at 020 7008 0151 or visit their\nwebsite\n.\nIf you feel you may be forced into marriage during a trip abroad, contact the FMU before you go.\nIf a relative or friend has not returned home from a trip abroad and you feel they may have been forced to marry, contact the FMU.\nIt may be helpful to the FMU if you can give them details such as where the person has gone, when they were due back, and when you last heard from them.\nThe FMU can provide confidential information and advice to those involved in forced marriages. They work with agencies in the UK and abroad to prevent forced marriages from taking place and to support those already in forced marriages. Anyone in the UK, regardless of nationality, will be offered advice and support.\nFMU contact details\nTelephone\n020 7008 0151 (Monday to Friday, 9 am-5 pm)\nTel Global Response Centre\nOut-of-hours telephone\n020 7008 1500\nEmail\nfmu@fco.gov.uk\nWebsite\nGOV.UK - Forced Marriage\nFurther Information\nFurther information can be found\nhere\n.\nWhat should you do if you or someone you know is at risk of abuse or neglect\nIf you suspect that someone is being abused, please do not ignore it.

WoW work with the Council to ensure women’s voices are heard and celebrated. The group also promotes International Women's Day/Women’s History Month.\nIt provides advice and guidance which contributes to the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion agenda of Knowsley Council, particularly as women make up over 70% of the total workforce.\nWe run regular Menopause café’s where those experiencing menopause can gain support and access information and work with Organisational Development to deliver a women’s Empowerment Programme in order to reduce the Gender Pay Gap.\nDisability Workers' Group\nThe Disability Workers’ Group (DWG) promotes equality for disabled employees within the workplace.  It works in an advisory and consultation role for the council, ensuring new and existing policies are appropriate for disabled people in Knowsley.  The group is also a source of advice and support.\nThe group aims to raise the profile of disability issues in the council and supports employees who identify as having a disability to make a lasting difference.\nThe DWG provides a forum to discuss disability-related issues and influence change in a positive fashion.\nNeurodiversity Support Group\nThe Neurodiversity Support group is a forum for colleagues to talk about neurodiversity topics, such as Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia and more.\nThe group meet every other month in Huyton on the second Thursday of the month.\nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Forum\nThe Knowsley Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Forum offers support and encouragement to employees who wish to join or contribute to their activities. One of the main aims of the group is to increase the profile of the council as an employer which is supportive of its LGBTQ+ workers, where their contribution to the council is celebrated and valued as part of a diverse workforce.\nThe group acts as a consultation forum for new policies and strategies and hopes to influence change and open a two-way process for exchanging ideas, problem solving, and information sharing. It assists employees with development and empowerment and aims to raise awareness and reduce discrimination within the workplace.\nBlack, Asian and Minority Workers' Group\nThe Black, Asian and Minority Workers' Group aims to influence cultural change, promote respect and value of cultural diversity within Knowsley.\nThe group provides an overview of issues and concerns, and identifies improvements in polices, practices and strategies. Operating as Black, Asian and Minority Workers Collective, it challenges all forms of discrimination, racial harassment and bullying while promoting race equality in employment and the delivery of services.\nThe group aims to work towards equality and diversity through an alliance with other Black, Asian & Minority Workers networks. It forms an alliance with other Knowsley Council issue worker groups and other black and minority worker groups regionally and nationally, and to contribute to the establishment of a black and minority worker network for empowerment and change.\nBelow are examples of what the group gets involved in:\nOffer support and encouragement to employees who wish to join or contribute to the activities of the group\nAssist with employee development and empowerment\nEngage in and promote networking opportunities with other councils and organisations at a local, regional and national level\nKnowsley Council Carer's Forum\nThe Knowsley Council Carer's Forum aims to offer support staff who are carers.  This includes providing advice and support for employees with caring responsibilities, signposting to information for carers which will encourage a culture towards supporting carers in and into work; and promoting the retention of staff who are or may become carers.\nYouth Employee Network\nThe Youth Employee Network was established in April 2024, as a space for young employees to:\nLearn - from one another but also senior officers and guest speakers\nConnect - with one another and build a network of peers across the council\nFeel Empowered - a space where members have a voice across the organisation\nThe group meets once a month and meetings can vary widely, from challenging organisational policies to networking or learning events. One of the highlights is our “Mystery Manager” series, where a senior officer attends and discusses their area service, their career journey and their development ‘top tips’. This allows members to learn from senior officers and allows us to have a deeper understanding of the different services within the council.\nThe Changies\nThe Changies is a men's support group , where Knowsley Council workers can have a safe space to discuss issues, share experiences and seek support. Based on the idea of the footy ‘changies’, the group is a chance to make new friends and contacts, have a laugh and help others.",

    "text": "What is a dropped kerb\nA dropped kerb enables vehicles to cross the public pavement (footway/verge) to access a private driveway. It allows safe, off-road parking and could add value to your property.\nThe dropped kerb access area remains part of the public highway and is maintained by the council. Utility apparatus, such as electricity and phone equipment within this area is maintained by the utility company such as Virgin Media and Scottish Power.\nThe dropped kerb and access across the footway do not become part of your land and must not be used for parking vehicles, as overhanging or obstructing a public footway is an offence.\nRequirements for dropped kerbs\nDriveway and planning considerations:\nTo qualify for a dropped kerb, you'll need space for a driveway on your property with a minimum size of 5.5 meters long by 3 meters wide to accommodate vehicle parking. The driveway must be in place before a dropped kerb can be constructed.\nStandard dropped kerbs are 3.6 meters wide, with an additional 0.9 meters on each side for transition curbs. The entire area from the kerb to your property will be strengthened to take the weight of a vehicle. Strengthening involves excavating and rebuilding the footpath to an appropriate thickness, often using concrete slabs.\nAny existing street furniture or utility equipment will need to be moved at your own expense.\nIf you request an extension to an existing dropped kerb, the existing section won't be automatically renewed. Renewing the entire area will incur additional costs. Please contact us before applying to discuss your options.\nPlanning permission might be required if you request a dropped kerb on a classified road (typically major roads).\nApplication\nTo request a quote for a dropped kerb, please contact our contractor, Tarmac.\nTelephone\n0800 023 2334\nEmail\nknowsley.highways@tarmac.com\nProcess\nTarmac will assess your request and provide a quotation outlining the next steps, including form submission and payment options. Once the process is complete you will receive an invoice from Knowsley Council, with a unique reference, and details on how you can pay. Once we’ve received payment, we will instruct Tarmac to proceed with the works.\nPlease note that we may decline certain requests if the driveway lacks sufficient parking space, has visibility concerns, or could negatively impact parking for surrounding properties. Each request is evaluated individually, and the cost reflects the specific details of your property.\nAccess protection markings\nAn access protection (h-bar) marking will not be included in your dropped crossing quote unless you request it.\nFind out more about requesting this marking here.\nUsing your own contractor\nIf you decide to use your own contractor it’s your responsibility to make sure that they:\nApply to us for Section 171 permit before they start any work, you will need to give them the reference number we gave you when we approved your request.\nTo apply for a Section 171 permit, contact\nNRSWA.Team@knowsley.gov.uk\n.\nHold public liability insurance of at least £10 million, which indemnifies you and us.\nEmploy trained and accredited workers in line with the codes of practice in the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.\nAccept and keep to any conditions which we set, for example saying that work can only take place during certain times, and any costs relating to this.\nAccept a two-year maintenance period after the work is done, the contractor and you will be responsible for any claims.\nGive us update notices confirming when the work has started and finished, and the registration of all reinstatement dimensions.\nGive us 20 days notice before the work starts.\nPlan the work out properly, and complete it efficiently.\nConstruct the works to the requirements set out in the\nHighways Construction Details\n.\nBefore any works commence, you must contact the council at\nknowsley.highways@tarmac.com\nfor an inspection quotation. The authority is required to check all the works and there is a charge for this service. This charge differs depending on the extent of the works.",

Many people who enquire about becoming a Shared Lives carer often tell us that they ‘probably aren’t right’ but the truth is if you care, have a spare bedroom and time, then you are.\nThe assessment process can take up to 3-4 months to complete, and, if successful, you will then be matched with a suitable person.\nA Shared Lives Carer can support up to 3 adults at a time, providing long term support or short breaks.\nHow Shared Lives carers are paid\nShared Lives Carers are not paid by the hour, and do not work to a fixed schedule. They get paid in line with the expectations set out in agreed daily or weekly rate. This can include a payment from the service user and a Housing Benefit rent contribution.\nShared Lives carers are not employed by the council, they are self-employed. This means they have to pay their own tax and national insurance. They can get the Shared Lives tax break.\nWe will offer you training, support and guidance about how to support people in different situations, and we encourage all Shared Lives carers to attend regular training.\nOur training includes assessment and induction\nOne day induction training\nOne to one training during the assessment process\nSome of the essential training courses, which we expect all carers to attend are:\nSafeguarding\nEmergency first aid\nManual handling\nFood hygiene\nHealth and safety\nMedicines management\nOther courses are available dependent on the needs of our service users for example epilepsy or autism awareness.\nContact\nIf you'd like to become a Shared Lives carer we'd love to hear from you!\nTelephone\n0151 443 2060\nEmail\nknowsleysharedlives@knowsley.gov.uk",

The procedure will tell you who to address the complaint to and when you should expect a response by.\nYou will find the school’s complaints policy on the school website, or you can contact the school office to request a paper copy. A list of all Knowsley schools can be found\nhere\n.\nHow to raise a concern or make a complaint\nAny concerns you have about your child’s education can normally be settled, in the first instance, in an informal way by speaking to your child’s teacher, the office staff, Head of Year or another key staff member.\nBuilding positive relationships is important to schools, and schools recognise that it is in everyone’s best interest that complaints are resolved as soon as possible. Your concerns will be taken seriously, and every effort will be made to resolve matters in accordance with school policy. If you are unsure who to speak to, contact the school office for advice.\nYou should not approach individual governors to raise concerns or complaints—they have no power to act individually, and this may prevent them from considering any formal complaint made at a later stage.\nWhen the school receives a complaint, they will investigate it in accordance with their own procedures.\nFormal complaint\nIf, after the informal stage, the issue is not resolved and you wish to make a formal complaint, you should refer to the school’s complaints procedure for the next steps you need to take.\nThe school complaints procedure will tell you how to make a formal complaint.  There are generally a few stages to this, which are outlined below, but referring to each individual policy for the school’s individual process is essential.\nStage 1\nThe first step is to complete a complaint form or put the issues in writing to the Headteacher. Individual school policies will indicate support that can be extended should it be difficult to express concerns in writing.\nYou should make it clear:\nWhy are you complaining?\nWho have you spoken to already?\nWhat do you want to happen as a result of your complaint?\nThe Headteacher will then investigate the complaint and provide a written response.\nStage 2\nIf the complainant is not satisfied with the outcome of the Stage 1 response, the complainant can move the complaint to Stage 2 of the process, where a written complaint is received directly to the Governing Body/Trust Board. The Chair of Governors/Trust Board will ensure that the complaint was dealt with appropriately at the previous stage and that the complaint is presented to an independent Complaints or Appeal Panel drawn from the governors/trustees.\nA written response detailing decisions and recommendations will be provided.\nStage 3\nIf the complainant remains unhappy with the way in which procedures have been carried out, the complaint can move to Stage 3 of the process.  The complainant will be notified of the right to appeal to the Secretary of State for Education.\nAnonymous complaints\nSchools do not investigate anonymous complaints unless there is sufficient information to warrant an investigation.\nHow long will it take to deal with a formal complaint\nTimescales for dealing with complaints are detailed in individual school complaints policies for each stage.\nWhat to do if you are not satisfied with how the school has handled your complaint\nKnowsley Council does not operate a review service for school complaints or have the authority to intervene or overturn decisions made by the governors. If you remain dissatisfied with the school response, and you have exhausted the school complaints procedure in full, you can contact the Department for Education and request that they review your complaint.\nThis can either be\nonline\nor in writing:\nDepartment for Education\nPiccadilly Gate\nStore Street\nManchester\nM1 2WD\nTelephone: 0370 000 2288",

You should contact Knowsley school admissions service confirming the reasons why a change is being requested and provide evidence of the change of circumstances resulting in a change of preference request, for example proof of exchange of contracts to confirm a house move.

You are strongly advised not to refuse a place that has been offered unless you have secured another school place.\nTimeframe for considering late applications\nLate/new applications naming Knowsley schools as preference received up to midnight on 30 April 2025 will be considered together and the outcome confirmed within 10 working days.\nLate/new applications received from 1 May will be processed as quickly as possible and outcomes for Knowsley schools issued within 10 working days.\nLate/new applications for Knowsley residents naming schools in other authority areas will be sent to the relevant authority as soon as is practicable and applicants will be informed of outcomes in accordance with the timeframes of that authority.\nOther changes of circumstances\nIt is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure the information on the application is correct. If a change takes place after the application is submitted, you should notify the school admissions service without delay as this may affect how the application is considered.

    "text": "Applications for places in year 7 of secondary schools for the current school year 2024/25 should now be made by following in-year admission/transfer procedures for Knowsley secondary schools.\nLate applications for admission to secondary school in September 2025 after the national closing date of 31 October\nIf you live in Knowsley and have not yet applied for your child to transfer to secondary education in September 2025, or if you want to make a new application, you can do this by visiting the online application portal, which will remain open until 31 August 2025.\nTo make a late application you can access the online portal here\nAlternatively, contact the school admissions team to request a paper application form.\nIf you live in another authority area but would like to apply for a place in a Knowsley school, contact your home authority who will co-ordinate your late application.\nSome schools require a supplementary information form to be completed in addition to the application form – find more information about this at\nSupplementary Information Forms | Knowsley Council\nApplications received after the allocation process has begun\nApplications received after the initial allocation process has begun, will not be considered by the admission authorities of Knowsley schools until the initial allocation process is complete. Only where the admission authority accepts there are exceptional circumstances, will late applications be considered in the initial allocation.\nIf you believe there are exceptional reasons for your application being late, it is your responsibility to confirm this and provide supporting evidence when you make the application. The deadline for exceptional circumstance consideration for late secondary school applications is 20 January 2025, any applications received after this date will not be considered until after the initial allocation is complete (after national offer day).\nChange of school preference/s\nUp to the national closing date (31 October 2024), online applicants can make changes to their school preferences by logging into their account via the application portal to make the change and resubmit the application.  Those who have applied by paper application must contact the school admissions service to request a change of preference.\nA change of preference during the allocation period will only be accepted if there are substantial or exceptional reasons, for example a change of address. You should contact Knowsley school admissions service confirming the reasons why a change is being requested and provide evidence of the change of circumstances resulting in a change of preference request, for example proof of exchange of contracts to confirm a house move. The deadline for change of preference due to exceptional circumstance for secondary school applications is 20 January 2025, any change requested after this date will not be considered until after the initial allocation is complete (after national offer day).\nMaking a change to your school preferences after national offer day\nAny new application you submit will replace your original/previous application.\nIf your child has been refused a place at a school/s of preference and you plan to appeal and/or want them to remain on the waiting list, you must still list the school/s as preference on your new application. If you did not previously use all your preference options, you can add new preferences, or remove schools previously named - if you no longer wish to continue with the application to them - and name different schools on your new application.\nAny current school offer will not be withdrawn unless a new school offer is being made. You are strongly advised not to refuse a place that has been offered unless you have secured another school place.\nTimeframe for considering late applications\nLate/new applications naming Knowsley schools as preference received up to midnight on 17 March 2025 will be considered together and the outcome confirmed within 10 working days.\nLate/new applications received from 18 March will be processed as quickly as possible and outcomes for Knowsley schools issued within 10 working days.\nLate/new applications for Knowsley residents naming schools in other authority areas will be sent to the relevant authority as soon as is practicable and applicants will be informed of outcomes in accordance with the timeframes of that authority.\nOther changes of circumstances\nIt is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure the information on the application is correct. If a change takes place after the application is submitted, you should notify the school admissions service without delay as this may affect how the application is considered. A place may be withdrawn if it is offered based on information on the application that is incorrect.\nIf the change is in relation to information provided on a supplementary information form, you should contact the individual school directly to discuss making a change to the form.\nIf you are unsure about what is a relevant change, contact Knowsley School Admissions Service for advice.",

It does not apply to the annual allocation of reception class places in primary school or year 7 places in secondary schools.\nThe Fair Access Protocol ensures that no individual school is asked to admit a disproportionate number of children who have been excluded from other schools or who display challenging behaviour, or who are being placed via other categories of the protocol.\nThe Fair Access Panel does not have to comply with parental preference for a school place and can agree placements beyond the usual admission limit, or refuse where places might otherwise be available.\nThe Knowsley Fair Access protocol can be found below:\nDocument\nKnowsley Fair Access Protocol.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n158.35KB\n)",

    "text": "Domestic abuse is a significant national and local issue, having a major impact on those directly affected and their families. Domestic abuse has significant short and long-term effects on victims and their families; this includes physical injuries, mental health issues, and behavioural issues that can lead to substance misuse, self-harm, and suicide. There are, sadly, occasions when domestic abuse can result in the death of a person, which is known as a domestic homicide.\nA “domestic homicide” is defined as the death of a person aged 16 or over which has, or appears to have, resulted from violence, abuse or neglect either by a person to whom the deceased was related or with whom the deceased was in an intimate relationship with, or was a member of the same household as the victim.  Under these circumstances, Section 9 of the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act 2004 places a legal duty on the Knowsley Community Safety Partnership (the Partnership) to conduct a Review into a death. In Knowsley, the Community Safety Service coordinates the review process following the completion/conclusion of any criminal justice process.\nThe Knowsley Community Safety Partnership must appoint an Independent Author and an Independent Chairperson to undertake the domestic homicide review. The purpose of a domestic homicide review is to:\nEstablish lessons which could be learned regarding the way in which local professionals and organisations work individually and together to safeguard victims.\nIdentify clearly what those lessons are within and between agencies, how and within what timescales they will be acted on, and what is expected to change.\nApply these lessons to service responses, including changes to inform national and local policies and procedures as appropriate.\nPrevent domestic violence and homicide and improve service responses for all domestic violence and abuse victims.\nContribute to a better understanding on the nature of domestic violence and abuse; and,\nHighlight good practice.\nFor information in relation to Knowsley domestic homicide reviews/domestic abuse-related deaths, please email\nDHR@knowsley.gov.uk.\nRecent Knowsley domestic homicide reviews (DHR KMBC)\nDHR KMBC01\nOverview report KMBC01 (2013)\nAction Plan KMBC01 (2013)\nDHR KMBC 02/ Safeguarding Adults Review (SAR)\nSAR/DHR Overview report into the death of Margaret (2016)-not published.\nSummary report into the death of Margaret -not published.\nHome Office Feedback Letter - not published.\nAction Plan Margaret -not published.\nFor information in relation to DHR KMBC 02/ Safeguarding Adults Review (SAR), email\nDHR@knowsley.gov.uk\nDHR KMBC03\nOverview report into the death of Victoria (2017) – not published.\nAction Plan Victoria (2017) – not published.\nHome Office Feedback Letter Victoria (2021) – not published\nFor information in relation to DHR KMBC 03:  email\nDHR@knowsley.gov.uk\nDHR KMBC04\nOverview report into the death of Alison (2020) - not published.\nAction Plan - Alison (2020) – not published.\nHome Office Feedback Letter – 2023 - not published.\nFor information in relation to DHR KMBC 04: email\nDHR@knowsley.gov.uk\nDHR KMBC05\nOverview report into the death of Diana (2020)\nAction Plan - Diana\nHome Office Feedback Letter – Diana 2024 - not published.\nFor information in relation to DHR KMBC 05: email\nDHR@knowsley.gov.uk\nFurther information\nHome Office multi-agency statutory guidance for the conduct of domestic homicide reviews\nLeaflets from the Home Office website\nAAFDA - Advocacy After Fatal Domestic Abuse\n- offers support to those affected by a domestic homicide, regardless of whether they are involved in a homicide review",

    "text": "Over a prolonged period of time, concerns have been raised with the Council over large commercial vehicles causing obstructive and indiscriminate parking and therefore causing safety concerns for pedestrians, as well as access and egress issues for vehicles accessing premises on Moss End Way, Woodward Road and Acornfield Road, Kirkby. As a result, the Council is receiving an increased number of complaints regarding inconsiderate, obstructive, and dangerous parking within the area. These inconsiderately parked vehicles also increase the risk of head on collisions taking place.\nWhat is proposed?\nThe Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO) will deliver mitigations to manage obstructive and indiscriminate on-street parking on Moss End Way, Woodward Road and Acornfield Road, Kirkby, by way of introducing Red Route (no stopping at any time) restrictions.\nThe Experimental Traffic Regulation Order will include;\nIntroduction of Red Route (No stopping at any time) restrictions, prohibiting vehicles from stopping at any time within the parameters of the Red Route.\nProviding a safer route for cyclists and pedestrians.\nImproved access and egress for vehicles accessing premises on Moss End Way, Woodward Road and Acornfield Road.\nDocuments\nDocument\nMoss End Way Proposal Plan.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n333.34KB\n)\nThe above-mentioned scheme will be introduced on a trial basis via an Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO) which will be implemented and enforced over the coming weeks and will be in place for a maximum period of 18 months.\nHave your say\nDuring the first six months of the Experimental Traffic Order, we actively invite you to provide your comments and feedback to us. This will give the Council the opportunity to consider your views and in doing so, help us decide whether to make changes to the scheme, make the scheme permanent or withdraw the scheme, and revert to the existing situation.\nPlease send your views and feedback to\nHighway.Consultations@knowsley.gov.uk\nand entitle your email Moss End Way ETRO by Monday 19th May 2025.\nHow will the scheme be enforced?\nThe proposed order will be enforced by the Council’s team of Civil Enforcement Officers. It should be noted that Penalty Charge Notices (PCN’s) can be issued instantly as no observation period is required with No Stopping at Any Time / Red Route orders, which will further deter abuse of the restriction. It should also be noted that postal PCNs will also be issued to vehicle drive always or on occasions where the PCN cannot be physically handed to the driver or affixed to the vehicle.",

We are always glad to hear from people who are satisfied with the services we offer.\nAll compliments are recorded, and a copy is sent to the relevant service manager to provide feedback to the member of staff or service.\nWe deal with complaints in line with the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman’s complaint code.\nWhen you complain to us, we should put right what has gone wrong and learn from it.\nIf you have submitted a request for a service, your form will be passed to the service area for action. If necessary, they will contact you directly with any updates.\nIf your complaint relates to Children or Adult Social Care Services, you can also telephone\n0151 443 3231\n.\nFurther information can be found below.\nCompliments, complaints and feedback procedure\nCompliments, complaints and feedback procedure\nMost common Report It issues\nThe most common ‘report it’ issues are:\nReport a missed bin collection\nReport dog fouling\nReport a problem with a road or pavement\nReport a faulty or broken streetlight\nReport fly-tipping\nReport noise\nReport another problem\nIf you have not already reported your issue to the service, we may treat it as a first-time service request, such as a missed bin collection.\nWhat cannot be considered under the complaint procedure\nThe complaint procedure does not include issues where there is a right of appeal, such as refusal of planning permission, a damage or injury claim, issue of a penalty charge or fixed penalty notice and blue badge, housing benefit or council tax reduction appeals. However, the complaint may be considered if it relates to the way the matter has been administered.\nThere are certain matters the Council do not deal with through the complaint process and stages in this procedure. The council offers a variety of services, and there may be more suitable methods for addressing certain issues.\nService requests\nInitial service requests are not part of the complaints process. Service requests are defined as \"a request that the organisation provides or improves a service, fixes a problem or reconsiders a decision\". This could be you alerting us for the first time that action is required i.e. reporting a missed bin or a broken streetlight.\nThese requests may however become a complaint if we do not deal with them appropriately, as referenced in the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman's complaint handling code:\nService requests are not complaints but may contain expressions of dissatisfaction. Organisations should have the opportunity to deal with a service request before a complaint is made. A complaint may be raised when the individual expresses dissatisfaction with the response to their service request, even if the handling of the service request remains ongoing.\nIf the Council receives a request for a service via the Have Your Say process, the service request will be sent to the relevant Team for the request to be responded to.\nRepeat Complaints\nAny complaint that has been fully responded to previously.\nComplaints regarding issues that occurred over twelve months ago\nWe would not normally investigate complaints about something that happened more than a year ago, unless there are exceptional circumstances.\nComplaints about councillors or MPs\nIf you believe an elected member or co-opted member has breached the Council’s code of conduct, further information and how to submit a complaint can be found\nhere\n.\nFor MPs contact:\nOffice of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards\nHouse of Commons\nLondon\nSW1A 0AA\nEmail:\nstandardscommissioner@parliament.uk\nPhone:\n020 7219 1883\nMaking an insurance claim against the Council\nInsurance claims are not covered under this policy.

If you have serious concerns about our staff, please come forward and let us know. All concerns will be treated in the strictest of confidence.

Following the review, if you remain unhappy, you will need to ask the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman to consider whether or not our decision has been reasonable.\nYou can write to the Ombudsman at;\nLocal Government and Social Care Ombudsman\nPO Box 4771\nCoventry\nCV4 0EH\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.lgo.org.uk/\nPhone:\n0300 061 0614\nEmployment Issues\nComplaints made by employees concerning their employment will be referred to Human Resources to be considered in line with internal HR procedures.\nComplaints made by job applicants who wish to complain about the recruitment and selection process will be dealt with by the relevant recruitment manager.\nComplaints about social care services\nThere are two acts of parliament that require local authority social care services to have a procedure for considering representations (including complaints) by an individual or anyone acting on their behalf in relation to the discharge of, or any failure to discharge, any of their social services functions.\nThe two acts are:\nThe Children Act 1989 Representations Procedure (England) Regulations 2006\nThe Local Authority Social Services and National Health Service Complaints (England)Regulations 2009\nComplaints about either adult or children’s social care issues are dealt with under separate statutory timescales and are outside this policy.\nComplaints relating to Freedom of Information Requests (FOI’S) / Environmental Information Regulation Requests (EIR’s)\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to your freedom of information request or environmental information regulation request the matter can be escalated with a request for an internal review.\nInternal review requests should be made within 40 working days of the initial response. Knowsley Council are not obliged to provide a review if it is requested after more than 40 working days. We will acknowledge an internal review request and provide a target date for response, which should usually be within 20 working days.\nThere may be circumstances where we may require more time to complete an internal review, for example if we need to address complex issues, consult with third parties, or consider substantial amounts of information.\nIn these circumstances we will inform the requestor that we will need more time and provide a reasonable target date. This should be no more than an additional 20 working days unless there are legitimate reasons why a longer extension is necessary.\nAs with requests for information, if we require clarification for your internal review request then the timescale to respond does not start until the clarification is provided by you.\nProviding an internal review within a maximum of 40 working days matches the timescales for internal reviews in the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR) - in which internal reviews are a statutory requirement.\nThe\nFreedom of Information code of practice can be viewed here\n.\nStage One\nThis is the first stage, and we will acknowledge receipt of your complaint within 3 working days. Our acknowledgement can be made verbally or in writing and will include confirmation that your complaint has been received and the date or timeframe by which you can expect to receive a response.\nThe complaint will be passed to the service area, who will arrange for the investigation and a response within 15 working days from the date of the complaint.

On some occasions a complaint may be resolved by telephone however, you will receive a follow-up email or letter confirming the details of the conversation.\nEvery effort will be made to resolve your complaint at stage one.\nStage Two\nIf you remain dissatisfied following our initial investigation, you can ask for your complaint to be looked at again by a senior officer. There may be instances when the council will advise you to refer your concerns directly to the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman (LGO) following the Stage One response. This will be clearly explained to you and will only occur when the council is satisfied that you have had an opportunity to have your queries considered and all issues raised by you have been addressed.\nWe ask that that this is done within a reasonable timescale. We would expect a complaint to be progressed within 20 working days of a stage one response, however, this this can be extended in exceptional circumstances.\nWhen requesting a review of your complaint, it is helpful for you to be clear in your reasons for progressing your complaint and what your desired outcome is.\nWe will appoint a senior officer to review your complaint independent of the service area you have complained about. The complaint will be acknowledged within 3 working days as at the initial stage.\nIn the review, we will look at how we dealt with your original complaint, and we will also respond to any further related issues that you have raised with us (although not new complaints). Our policy is to respond in full to you within 20 working days of receipt of your complaint, wherever possible.\nIf we cannot respond in full within the acknowledged timescale, we will provide you with a holding response providing you with the date you should expect a response.\nNext steps\nThere is no further right of appeal to the council following completion of a review at stage two of this policy. Within our final response, we will inform you of your right to take your complaint further if you remain dissatisfied.\nLocal Government and Social Care Ombudsman\nThe Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman look at individual complaints about councils, all adult social care providers (including care homes and home care agencies) and some other organisations providing public services. They are the final stage for complaints about councils and they are a free service. The LGO will not usually investigate a complaint until the council has had an opportunity to investigate and answer it first.\nThe Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman\nPO Box 4771\nCoventry\nCV4 0EH\nPhone:\n0300 061 0614\nLocal Government and social care ombudsman website\nPolicy for Managing Unreasonable Actions by Complainants\nSome customers act in ways we consider unreasonable when trying to resolve their complaints.\nWe take all complaints seriously and aim to resolve them fairly. Usually, we can work with complainants to reach a solution that works for both sides. However, if communication becomes difficult, we may need to take appropriate steps.\nThe Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman defines unreasonable actions as:\nUnreasonable actions are those which, because of the nature or frequency of contact with an organisation, hinder the organisation’s delivery of services or consideration of complaints.\nWe have a specific policy to address these situations and outline our approach, which can be found\nhere\n.\nSubmit a compliment, complaint or provide feedback\nSubmit your compliment, complaint or provide feedback online via the link below.

You can tell us that we need to review or investigate something\nhere\n. We hope to resolve most complaints this way, as it lets us put things right quickly so that you receive the service you deserve.\nComplaints about Adult Social Care Services are dealt with under the Adult Social Care Complaints Procedure, which complies with the statutory requirement set out in the Local Authority Social Services and National Health Complaints (England) Regulations 2009. This can be viewed\nhere\n.\nAdult social care complaints procedure\nAdult Social Care compliments, complaints and feedback procedure\nWho can make a complaint\nA complaint is defined as an expression of dissatisfaction about the actions, decisions or apparent failings of the council’s adult social care provision which requires a response.\nSometimes, customers report ‘concerns’ regarding a social care service. This should be done by contacting the appropriate service, and concerns should be resolved informally and quickly without using the formal complaints procedure.\nIf a complaint is received and resolved to the complainant’s satisfaction no later than the third working day, there is no need to engage the complaints process. For example, if a complaint was received from a customer who had not received a telephone call when agreed, immediate corrective action can be taken, the call is made, and the customer is satisfied, then it is not necessary or appropriate for this to be a formal complaint.\nA complaint may be made by a representative acting on behalf of a person who has died or is unable to make the complaint themselves because of:\nPhysical incapacity, or\nLack of capacity within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, or\nHas requested that a representative act on their behalf\nAppropriate written consent must be provided in these instances\nA complaint by a representative will not be considered if the council is satisfied the representative is not acting in the complainant's best interests. If this occurs, the council will inform the representative in writing of the reason for this decision.\nReasons why we will not investigate under the complaint’s procedure\nThere is a 12-month time limit from the time the issue being complained about occurred to the time a complaint may be made. After this time, a complaint will not normally be considered. The 12-month time limit does not apply where the council is satisfied the complainant has good reasons for not making the complaint within the time limit and where it is still possible to investigate the complaint effectively and fairly.\nSometimes, a complaint is not dealt with under this policy. This includes when there is a separate appeal or review procedure. This may be an internal council procedure or external legal process through the courts. If this is the case, we will explain this when you first contact us and tell you what to do next.\nSocial Care Provider or Voluntary Agency complaints\nWhere the Council has commissioned a service, the provider will have a complaints procedure of their own; however, the council will take the lead in ensuring the complaint is responded to.\nIf a complaint is sent to the Customer Liaison Team, we will inform the customer that we will contact the provider regarding the complaint. If they object, they need to contact us. The complaint will be sent to the provider, and they will be asked to investigate and respond. This will ensure that all provider complaints or concerns brought to the attention of KMBC will be investigated and responded to.\nService Users with Personal Budgets\nIf the complaint relates to the employment of a carer whom a customer pays using their personal budget, the statutory complaints procedure cannot be used for this.\nIf the complaint relates to a provider that customers use and pay for using their personal budget, it needs to go directly to the provider involved. However, as the council is responsible for the quality of care in the borough, the complainant will be supported in making the complaint.\nHowever, if a complaint relates to the service's assessment of a customer’s needs and care management process or the way in which payments are managed by the finance team (in respect of either a customer’s or carer’s personal budget), this can be investigated and responded to using the complaints procedure.\nStage One\nThis is the first stage, and we will acknowledge receipt of your complaint within 3 working days. Our acknowledgement can be made verbally or in writing and will include confirmation that your complaint has been received and the date or timeframe by which you can expect to receive a response.\nThe complaint will be passed to the service area, who will arrange for the investigation and a response within 15 working days from the date of the complaint.

If this is the case, we will explain this when you first contact us. We will tell you what to do next.\nStage 1 - Problem-solving and attempt to resolve issues\nWe will give your complaint to a manager to look into. Most problems can be dealt with quickly and informally at this stage, which is better for everyone. Statutory guidelines say we have to deal with your complaint within 10 working days.\nIf the case is more complex an extra 10 working days is allowed, to permit a more complete response.\nIf you are not happy with the outcome of your complaint, you can ask to go to the next stage.\nStage 2 - Formal enquiries and independent investigation\nAt this point an Investigating Officer is chosen, who does not work in the part of the Children Services you are complaining about.\nThey are helped by an Independent Person to make sure the investigation is fair and thorough. They have no direct links with the team or individual being complained about, they may want to meet with you in person to check they understand what your complaint is.\nStatutory guidelines say Stage 2 investigations are to be completed in 25 working days, but this timescale can extend to a maximum of 65 working days and if this happens, we will keep you informed.\nStage 3 - Independent review panel considers complaint\nThis will be held within 30 working days of receiving the request and will consider the reasons for your continued dissatisfaction.\nThe Independent Review Panel is made up of 3 people who do not work for the Children Services\nFollowing the review, the panel will make recommendations to the Council within 5 working days in their report. This will also be shared with you. The Assistant Executive Director will write back within 15 working days with the Local Authorities response to the recommendations and what actions will be taken if required.\nLocal Government and Social Care Ombudsman\nIf, after your complaint has been investigated at Stage 3 of the statutory procedure, you remain unhappy you have the right to refer your complaint to the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman\nPostal Address:\nLocal Government and Social Care Ombudsman\nPO Box 4771\nCoventry\nCV4 0EH\nTelephone:\n0300 061 0614\nLocal Government and social care ombudsman website\nHelp to make a complaint\nYou can ask a family member or a friend to make a complaint on your behalf. We’ll need your permission for us to deal with another person before we accept your complaint.\nPlease tell us if you need any other support to make a complaint. We can tell you about the advocacy services provided locally to help you to have your say.\nPolicy for Managing Unreasonable Actions by Complainants\nSome customers act in ways we consider unreasonable when trying to resolve their complaints.\nWe take all complaints seriously and aim to resolve them fairly. Usually, we can work with complainants to reach a solution that works for both sides. However, if communication becomes difficult, we may need to take appropriate steps.\nThe Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman defines unreasonable actions as:\nUnreasonable actions are those which, because of the nature or frequency of contact with an organisation, hinder the organisation’s delivery of services or consideration of complaints.\nWe have a specific policy to address these situations and outline our approach, which can be found\nhere\n.\nSubmit a compliment, complaint or provide feedback\nSubmit your compliment, complaint or provide feedback online via the link below.

We have a specific policy to address these situations and outline our approach.\nWe take all complaints seriously and aim to resolve them fairly. Usually, we can work with complainants to reach a solution that works for both sides. However, if communication becomes difficult, we may need to take appropriate steps.\nThis policy explains how we will handle cases where a person's actions are unacceptable, especially if they involve mistreatment of staff or misuse of the complaint process. It applies when a customer has filed a formal complaint. If customer interactions fall outside the complaints policy, other policies may be relevant.\nThe Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman defines unreasonable actions as:\nUnreasonable actions are those which, because of the nature or frequency of contact with an organisation, hinder the organisation’s delivery of services or consideration of complaints.\nIf we find that your actions regarding your complaint are unreasonable, we will explain our reasoning and the issues it is creating. Additionally, we will outline our proposed approach for future communication with you.\nExamples of unreasonable behaviour include but not exhaustive:\naggressive or abusive language\nmaking excessive demands for information, documents or requesting actions outside the complaint procedure\nsending large volumes of correspondence or an excessive number of contacts\nrefusing to specify the grounds of a complaint, despite offers of assistance\nrefusing to co-operate with the complaint’s investigation process\nrefusing to accept that certain issues are not within the scope of a complaint’s procedure\ninsisting on the complaint being dealt with in ways which are incompatible with the adopted complaints procedure or with good practice\nmaking unjustified complaints about staff who are trying to deal with the issues and seeking to have them replaced\nchanging the basis of the complaint as the investigation proceeds\ndenying or changing statements he or she made at an earlier stage\nintroducing trivial or irrelevant new information at a later stage\nraising numerous, detailed but unimportant questions; insisting they are all answered\ncovertly recording meetings and conversations\nsubmitting falsified documents from themselves or others\nadopting a 'scatter gun' approach: pursuing parallel complaints on the same issue with a variety of organisations or departments within the council\nmaking excessive demands on the time and resources of staff with lengthy phone calls, emails to numerous council staff, or detailed letters every few days, and expecting immediate responses\nsubmitting repeat complaints with minor additions/variations that the complainant insists make these 'new' complaints\nrefusing to accept the decision; repeatedly arguing points with no new evidence.\nHow we will communicate with you\nWe will reach out to you in writing to explain our reasons for considering your behaviour to be unreasonable.\nIn cases where you have an ongoing complaint:\nwe will provide updates regarding the status of your complaint and the expected timeline for our response\nwe will clarify the reasonable ways for you to make contact while your complaint is under investigation, along with the rationale for this\nwe may impose limits on the frequency of contact that is considered acceptable concerning your complaint\nIn instances where your complaint has fully utilized the Council’s complaints policy:\nwe will confirm that your complaint has gone through the Council’s complaints process and will guide you towards the appropriate escalation channels\nShould unreasonable behaviour continue after these measures have been implemented, it may result in restrictions on your communication with the Council.\nThe specifics of the restriction will be communicated in writing, including a designated review period for the restriction.\nIf you contest the restrictions, we will take your concerns into account and assess whether the restriction has been applied appropriately. Should you disagree with the outcome of this review, you have the option to request that the Local Government Ombudsman and Social Care Ombudsman evaluate the reasonableness of our decision.\nYou can contact the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman at:\nPO Box 4771\nCoventry\nCV4 0EH\nPhone:\n0300 061 0614\nWebsite:\nwww.lgo.org.uk",

You can find the\nlist of authorised fuels here\n. If you are using a DEFRA-approved appliance, please consult the specification documents for the correct fuel for those appliances.\nExempt appliances that can burn unauthorised fuels\nSome fuels that are not on DEFRA’s authorised fuels list, such as dried wood logs, can be used in an exempt appliance; however, you can still only burn the type of fuel specified in the instructions for the appliance.\nDetails of exempt appliances can be found here\n.\nYou must only use the types of fuel that the manufacturers say can be used in the appliances.\nUnder the Clean Air Act 1993, you could receive a £300 Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) if you emit smoke from your chimney in a smoke control area. Failure to pay the FPN could lead to prosecution and a fine of up to £1,000. Regardless of whether you are in a smoke control area or not, you may also be prosecuted if the smoke causes a statutory nuisance to other residents.\nWhy it matters\nAir pollution impacts the health and well-being of everyone, particularly children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions such as asthma. Harmful smoke and pollutants in the air can aggravate breathing difficulties, trigger asthma attacks, and contribute to long-term health problems like heart disease and lung cancer. By reducing smoke and other air pollutants, we can create a healthier environment for our community and protect our most vulnerable residents.\nHow can you help?\nSwitch to authorised fuels.\nAvoid open fires in smoke control areas.\nUse approved stoves and heaters.\nIf you are considering buying an appliance, please consider a DEFRA-approved appliance.\nDownloads\nDocument\nKeep it Clean Flyer.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.4MB\n)\nStill not sure if your fuel or appliance is allowed?

Currently, there is no pedestrian crossing facility outside the shops.\nAfter reviewing the road layout, traffic flow, and the number of pedestrians crossing, it is proposed that two Zebra crossing facilities at either end of the shops are the most suitable solution and should be implemented.\nThe pedestrianised crossing will be located approximately 113 metres and 175 metres east of its junction with St Johns Road. This allows for access to the shops on the north side and houses on the south side of Manor Farm Road.\nWhat is proposed?\nThe scheme will improve sustainable choices for travelling to local employment, education, retail, health, and recreation facilities. Walking can make a very positive contribution to improving health and tackling obesity, improving accessibility, tackling congestion, reducing carbon emissions and improving the local environment.\nDocuments\nDocument\nHP018-Statutory Consultation - Manor Farm Road.docx\n(\nDOCX\n,\n346.31KB\n)\nDocument\n20939-WAT-HGN-103-DR-D-950101 P04-Consultation.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n503.92KB\n)\nHave your say\nYour views on the proposals are important to us.

    "text": "Following on from the consultation last year, work is about to commence on an Active Travel and Capacity Improvement Scheme on Moorgate Road and the East Lancashire Road (A580) providing a fit for purpose, high quality, resilient network for the future.\nThe improvements will be delivered in two phases. Phase one, relating to Moorgate Road and the East Lancashire Road, is scheduled to commence in early 2025. This phase will commence from 24th to 28th of February.\nFurther details relating to the start of this phase, including road diversions that will be in place, can be viewed in the below information sheets.\nDocument\nInfo Sheet 1 - Site Establishment.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.01MB\n)\nDocument\nInfo Sheet 2 - A580 onto Moorgate Road North.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.28MB\n)\nDocument\nInfo Sheet 3 - Moorgate Road and East Lancashire Road Emergency info sheet.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n885.42KB\n)\nDocument\nInfo Sheet 4 - Moorgate Road and East Lancashire Road.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n998.94KB\n)\nPhase two, relating to Junction 4 of the M57 will commence in the summer of 2026. Full details of work to be undertaken within each phase can be viewed by clicking below.\nView details of the planned work here\nThe works will include:\nImprovements at the junction of Moorgate Road and East Lancashire Road (A580), with new separate cycle crossings constructed to improve the safety of cyclists whilst making their journey through the junction quicker and more efficient.\nA reduction in the speed limit of the East Lancashire Road from 50mph to 40mph between Alchemy Way and the boundary with Liverpool.\nImprovements for cyclists and pedestrians at Ribblers Lane, making it safer and easier to join up to existing cycle routes.\nCarriageway widening to create extra lanes and increase capacity and reduce congestion at both junctions.\nThe full signalisation of Junction 4 of the M57 and upgrading the existing signals at Moorgate Road Junction East Lancashire Road (A580).\nAll works will involve resurfacing, drainage and street lighting improvements where appropriate.\nM57 Frequently asked questions\nFrequently asked questions\nI am a driver, what are the benefits for me?\nThe improvements to the traffic signals will ease long term congestion as well as providing immediate benefits for non-motorised users. However, the other improvements will not just benefit cyclists and pedestrians, but all road users including children, less-able individuals and people making short trips around their community. These high-quality facilities will encourage non-motorised transport where possible and reduce congestion for those that need to use their vehicles.\nWhy is this happening?\nWe want to provide better links around Kirkby that reduce congestion for motor vehicles and encourage healthier and more varied modes of travel. Making non-motorised forms of transportation safer, more efficient, and more attractive makes local amenities, businesses, and places of work more accessible while reducing congestion on the highway for journeys that are made by car. This scheme supports the central government objective to provide better, sustainable transport links.\nWhat is the evidence base for this work?\nThere is wide public support for schemes of this type, 76% of Liverpool City Region residents think space should be increased for socialising, cycling, and walking on high streets and 61% believe that more should be invested in cycling and walking facilities. There are 300 million journeys under three miles long undertaken by car each year in the Liverpool City Region, most of these journeys could be undertaken without the use of a motor vehicle. However, around 75% of residents believe that cycling safety needs to be improved, and 63% believe that fewer motor vehicles on the roads would encourage them to cycle more.\nThis scheme seeks to attract non-motorised users (such as cyclists) by providing safer, more efficient facilities and because 76% of residents believe that cycle routes that are physically protected from traffic and pedestrians would encourage them to cycle more, we believe this scheme will have broad positive effects, in both attracting new users and making Kirkby more accessible using any form of transport.\nHow do you know that the junction upgrades will reduce congestion in the future?\nWe have undertaken extensive transportation modelling of the area; our models look at the existing infrastructure and traffic data and the effects of the expected developments and growth up to 2035. By comparing different scenarios, we have found that the proposal to upgrade the Moorgate Road Junction of East Lancashire Road provides the most robust solution and ensures that the junctions remain below capacity into the future.\nWhy is Road Tax / Council Tax funding new infrastructure for bikes and pedestrians?\nVehicle Excise Duty (the official name for road tax) does not fund infrastructure upgrades, and these works are not being funded by Council Tax.\nWho is paying for these works?\nThe main contributor for these works is central government via the City Region Sustainable Transport Settlement (CRSTS).\nThere are other projects we should be spending the money on…\nThe road network is used by a broad cross-section of society, and everyone has their own priorities. The funding obtained from central government for this scheme focuses on; relieving congestion, improving sustainable travel facilities and promoting economic growth.\nIf you have ideas or proposals for new projects, we are always happy to hear from you via our\nHighwaysEnquiries@knowsley.gov.uk\ninbox.\nHow will the construction works affect my day-to-day life?\nBoth phases will remain open at most times. There may be times when a road needs to be closed, but this will be done at a time that minimises disruption, such as at night. Full closures will be limited, and residents will be informed in advance of any closures. The road will remain open although at times we may need to install temporary traffic signals to facilitate the works safely.\nAccess to and from businesses and domestic properties will always be provided for all road users.\nWhy cannot cyclists ride on the road or footpath?\nCyclists move at different speeds to pedestrians and motor vehicles; on the road they are vulnerable to motorists and can cause issues for pedestrians on the footpath. Pedestrians, cyclists and motorists are three different forms of travel, each with their own requirements. Providing dedicated facilities along high-capacity routes improves efficiency and safety for all users.\nHow long will the construction take?\nThe works will be phased to minimise disruption, Phase 1 (Moorgate Road junction of East Lancashire Road) will take around twelve months. Initially the works will be focused on the Northwest side of the junction and work downwards towards the Southwest side of the scheme.\nPhase 2 (M57 Junction 4 roundabout) will start in 2026. You will be notified of the scheme with regards to start date and duration before construction starts. At this time, the duration of phase 2 is to be confirmed.\nHow can I contact the project team?\nPlease contact us via email at\nHighwaysEnquiries@knowsley.gov.uk\nor in writing at the address below:\nKnowsley Council\nStretton Way Depot\nStretton way\nHuyton\nKnowsley\nL36 6JF\nWho will benefit from this project?\nThere will be benefits for all road and non-motorised users. The upgraded junction will provide additional crossing facilities for non-motorists and additional capacity on the road. Providing quality cycle facilities can further reduce vehicles on the road, improving local air quality and easing congestion. For the residents of Kirkby, there will be better quality access in and around the community which does not require a motor vehicle.\nWill electric bikes (EAPCs) or e-scooters be able to use the new cycle facilities?\nKnowsley is not presently host to any e-scooter trials, so e-scooters are not permitted for use on any roads Knowsley.\nEAPCs, electrically assisted pedal cycles, can be used anywhere that a normal pedal bike can be used. They may be used in the cycleway providing the rider and the EAPC meets the legal requirements which can be found on the\ngov.uk website EAPC pages\n.",

    "text": "For many years concerns have been raised with the Council over the amount of school related traffic using Marina Crescent and adjacent roads during drop-off and pick-up times. This increases the risks of collisions between motorised traffic and vulnerable road users as well as with other vehicles.\nThe associated parking on the roads makes it difficult for other vehicles to pass, and causes visibility issues for children wanting to cross, whilst the pavement parking makes it dangerous and at times forces children to walk in the road.\nFurthermore, local residents have for a long-time experienced problems arising from anti-social and dangerous parking during school drop-off and pick-up times with people parking across their driveways and even driving along the pavement.\nWe have listened to the comments received during the last consultation in 2023 and are introducing a new scheme that will improve the active travel links in the area whilst addressing the safety concerns that were expressed by reducing traffic around Marina Crescent, Ruskin Way and Cedar Crescent during school opening times.\nProposed new footpath\nIt is also proposed to create a new footpath from Twickenham Drive to the rear of St Anne’s School. This will enable more people to walk or wheel to school from that estate and reduce the need to travel by vehicle.\nPlease note that this will be subject to a planning application.\nThe enclosed leaflet shows two potential locations for a new footpath. We would welcome feedback on whether option one or two is preferred before submitting the planning application.\nIf you have a preference, please contact us via email at\nschoolstreets@knowsley.gov.uk\nbefore 31st March 2025.\nDocuments\nDocument\nSchool Streets Booklet.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n1.71MB\n)\nDocument\nSchool Streets FAQs.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n458.33KB\n)\nDocument\nSchool Streets Plan - March 2025.pdf\n(\nPDF\n,\n467.81KB\n)\nWalk to School Week\nBefore the scheme is designed and introduced, a specific walk to school week will take place from the week commencing 24th March (Monday to Friday).\nAs part of this initiative Marina Crescent, Ruskin Way and Cedar Crescent will be closed at school opening and closing times (8.00 to 9.00 and 14.15 to 15.30) to replicate the proposed scheme. By undertaking a walk to school week, it will give the Highways Team an understanding of how the proposed ban of motor vehicles will operate and what may need to be considered in the project design.\nFurther information\nFor more information on School Streets please visit\nSchool Streets Initiative - All the information you need\nTo watch a video about real life examples please visit\nActive Travel: The Art of the Possible",

The Enforcement Agent may enter into a Controlled Goods Agreement, where the agent lists your possessions equal in value to your debt.\nIf your possessions are subject to a Controlled Goods Agreement, you cannot dispose or sell them without the Enforcement Agent's permission.\nIf you do not pay as agreed and have signed a Controlled Goods Agreement, the Enforcement Agent may enter your property by force if necessary, to take the goods listed. You will be charged for the removal and sale of them. The fee for this is £110 plus 7.5% for any balance due above £1,500.\nIf the Enforcement Agent believes that there are insufficient items to clear the debt, we will then consider other recovery options such as committal action, bankruptcy, imprisonment or a charging order against your property.",
